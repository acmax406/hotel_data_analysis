 · Everything.. I didn't book with breakfast but bought at the hotel and the continental breakie was great which came with toast egg and cornflakes including water and a juice.. Which my kids could share.. The smoothie bowl was Devine and very filling.. The staff were super helpful and accommodating.. A special shout out to Nop who after our transfer canceled van he hired a grab for us and even spoke to the driver to advise exactly where he should drop us off in Pattaya.. After checkout they kindly advised we would be more than welcome to wait.. My kids loved the hostel vibe of the rooms which also had a private shower and bathroom.. The wifi was awesome and super quick.. The place is very quirky with lots of charm.. It's easy to get a tuk Tuk to take you to the tourist spots in Bangkok. Loved the theme of old movie glam of the hotel and they also played movies for the guest..Disliked

 · A different kind of place to stay with a free classic film shown most evenings 
Set back off the street, so a quiet place just steps away from street vendors 
Staff are very friendly and helpfulDisliked
 · I stayed in one of the master suites. The room was lovely but the bathroom, despite the two hand basins seemed more appropriate for a hostel. If that was upgraded well it would be perfect. I’d still stay there again though",0,"Prince Theatre Heritage Stay

 · Absolutely amazing stay, I stayed in a dormitory with my husband and children aged 16 & 8 years. The dorm had two double beds and two single beds and our own private bathroom. Excellent location, I have never stayed anywhere like this before. Completely unique experience, hostel had everything we needed. Staff were brilliant, my Husband got his phone stolen one evening we were out exploring and when we returned to the hostel and informed a staff member they walked my Husband to the local police station and also translated for us.
 I hope to return in the future, thank you for an enjoyable stay.Disliked
 · The only negative that I would have to say was the mould in the shower and the foul smell coming up from the drain in the bathroom when you took a shower.

Grande salle de bain, clime et WiFi nickel, matelas super confortables.Disliked
 · Nous avions réservé un transfer à 4h du matin, payé à l'avance à la réception. Mais aucun chauffeur n'est venu, nous avons dû se débrouiller avec la sécurité de l'hôtel, qui ne parlait pas anglais, pour joindre un responsable qui nous a trouvé d'urgence un taxi. Problème résolu au final.
Les chambres pour 5 sont trop petites, couloir étroit pour monter dans les lits du haut.
Le personnel ne donne aucune indications sur les attractions autour sauf si on le demande, ils vous envoie directement dans les endroits super touristiques...
Cependant le personnel reste agréable. J'ai surtout aimé le barmaid, ils nous a donné les meilleurs indications.Show translation",0,"Prince Theatre Heritage Stay

 · L'endroit est top. Au cœur d'un quartier fourmillant de monde, à deux pas de petits restos de rue très bon marché, non loin du grand centre commercial Robinson, cet hôtel (et le personnel) est un bijou. On est à 5 minutes du métro ou du bateau bus, ce qui est parfait pour séjourner quelques jours et se déplacer partout dans Bkk. Ancien cinéma rénové avec goût, il y a des projections de films vintage tous les soirs. La literie est top, la salle de bain est bien et dans la douche il y avait savon et shampooing à disposition. On prenait le petit-déjeuner dehors dans la rue pour quelques bahts. 3 fois à Bangkok, 3 fois dans cet hôtel avec bonheur.Show translation",0,"Prince Theatre Heritage Stay

 · 深夜の到着＆早朝の出発でしたが、事前にしっかりと連絡を頂けて、チェックインの方法など丁寧に教えて頂けましたので安心して泊まれました。その他のことも、些細なことでも、メールで質問すれば丁寧にお返事を頂けて、家族で安心して利用することが出来ました。立地条件も大変よく、近くのロビンソンデパートにはスーパーとフードコート、マクドナルドなどがあり、お土産から簡単な食事まで済ますことが出来ます。歩いてサパーンタクシン駅まですぐなので、様々な観光地までチャオプラヤエクスプレスで行けますし、アジアンティークの送迎船も乗れます。ＢＴＳに乗ってＭＢＫに行くにも便利でした。夜の10時くらいでしたが、家族で歩いて駅から帰るのにも、まったく安全に問題ありませんでした。
事前にスタッフの方に教えて頂いた水上マーケット＆エレファントライドツアーに、メールで申し込み参加しましたが、早朝ロビーまで迎えに来てもらえて、値段も日本人向けのものより安く、帰りはカオサンロードで解散で、その後の観光にも便利でした。
部屋は狭いですが、それぞれのベッドスペースと荷物スペースがあるので、中高生の子供連れには最適でした。もちろん部屋はとても綺麗で、セキュリティも申し分ありません。エアコンが利きすぎて辛かったので、スッタフの方に相談したら、リモコンを貸して頂けて調節することが出来ました。リモコンは、すぐに返さなければいけませんが、問題はありませんでした。Disliked

 · Das Personal war super engagiert, wir haben tolle Tipps für die Umgebung erhalten, auch wurde uns ein Tagesausflug mit einem privaten Taxi nach Ayutthaya von der Unterkunft mit einem super netten Fahrer und günstiger als die Standartangebote organisiert. 
Die Unterkunft liegt 5 Minuten vom Fluss entfernt. Hier kann man entspannt mit dem öffentlich Boot alle Sehenswürdigkeiten erreichen. Gleichzeitig gibt es ein kostenlosen Shuttleservice zum neuen Shoppingcenter mit ""Nachtmarkt"" und Restaurants auf der anderen Flussseite. Den Skytrain, der hier auch eine Haltestelle hat, haben wir gar nicht genutzt. 
Die Unterkunft selber liegt mitten in einer belebten Strasse mit Streetfoodständen (tagsüber) in zweiter Reihe. Daher ist es hier sehr ruhig. Das alte Kino hat seinen eigenen Charm. Hier finden in den frühen Abendstunden auch kleine Veranstaltungen statt, an denen man gern teilnehmen kann.
Beim Frühstück gibt es mittlerweile drei Wahlmöglichkeiten: ein thailändisches Congee( kräftige Reissuppe), kontinentales Frühstück mit Toast, Saft und Warmgetränk oder eine eisgekühlte Smothiebowl mit Obst und Getränken. Auch bietet die Unterkunft Essen bis Abends um 10 Uhr in Kooperation mit umliegenden ausgezeichnten Streetfoodständen an.
Was nicht ganz klar in der Beschreibung rüber kommt: man bucht ein Mehrbettzimmer (kann auch mit weniger Personen als Betten belegt werden) und erhält dieses für sich und die mitgebuchten Gäste zur eigenen Verfügung. Jedem Zimmer ist ein eigenes Bad angegliedert, das nur diesem Zimmer zur Verfügung steht. Daher also ein Privatbad.
Vor der Ankunft haben wir von der Unterkunft eine Mail erhalten, wo wir auf dem Flughafen die richtigen Tagen finden und wie viel die Fahrt zur Unterkunft kosten darf. Das war sehr hilfreich, vor allem, wenn man müde aus dem Flugzeug steigt!Disliked

 · Great hotel for good price. Very nice staff, always helpful even with strange and unusual requests. ( I wanted to by one specific piece of Thai craft and all staff discussed where I can get it)
Comfortable and clean room. We had nice and spatious junior suite for our family (2+3). Interior design is really nice, a bit Art Deco and also comfortable and well designed. 
We really enjoyed swimming pool area. 
Overall good for business trips and family stay.Disliked
 · Beakfasts. To be precise food was really good but we had several problems with order. We stayed 7 days, after first day we knew what we want and our breakfast looked exatctly the same every day. Or rather should look as every single day something was missing. Definately there was some comunication issue.",1,"Montien Hotel Surawong Bangkok - SHA Extra Plus

 · room was very spacious and the hotel accommodated two baby cods which was great. the kids had to be under towels though as blankets were not provided. breakfast was good and so were the hotel facilities. 
what bothers me majorly is how we were scammed/ forced to pay a total of €550 for airport pickup (€350) and COVID testing (fam of 3 kids under 5 and 2 adults). the stay itself was about €250 for two nights. for comparison, a private chauffeur in a limousine was €100. the hotel could not explain this to us, aside from reservation saying we would be drive. to hospital for testing and that is why it was expensive, which we were not… as our visa was tied to this hotel we had to move forward with this crazy amount. furthermore, reservations was very slow in responding which in the end meant we needed to hire an agency to get out Thai Pass last minute resulting in another €1.000. in total we feel we got scammed for a total of 1.550.Disliked

 · - very good location, 
- friendly and helpful stuff 
- nice room
- nice pool area in villa chacha - the partner hotel where we had to move to
- both hotels stay away from the huge kaosan road noiseDisliked
 · - we checked in during the covid problematic abd we had to move after only 1 day
- they fooled me with the payment so they could make more money although many things in the hotel, including the pool from partner hotel, was closed. They refused to reduce the payment and lied to me about how to pay so the next hotel had the problem and told me totally different stories. After all it's the usual thing in thsiland to get a little bit ripped off as tourist.",4,"Sawasdee House

Отель преобразился, я в нем останавливаюсь каждый год и желания менять его на другой отель вообще не возникало никогда! Всем его рекомендую так как все, что нужно в том числе и Каосан роуд и центральная улица, магазины и Кафе в шаговой доступности!Show translation",4,"Sawasdee House

 · Отель преобразился после ремонта, стал светлее!!! Трёхместный номер улучшенной планировки с хорошим освещением внутри, наличие софы и 3 отдельных кроватей, душевая совмещённая с туалетом имеет отдельное место и для вешалки, что довольно удобно! Это все отличия улучшенного номера от обычных номеров этого отеля.Show translation",4,"Sawasdee House

Wenn man fragen zum Frühstück oder so stellt bekommt man eine patzige Antwort! 
Das beste ist aber: der sogenannte Pool liegt gar nicht mit am Hostel sondern man darf sich jeden Tag ab 10 Uhr eine Karte holen und mit der erst mal gut 300m in einer anderes Hotel laufen und da benutzt man den Pool mit.

The washroom is full of ants 🐜. The bathroom is super small and smelly. 
There is one annoying regulation which is forced you to take off your shoes before entering the hotel and use the provided slippers which is very disgusting. You have to use the public slippers, it is not acceptable at all. In addition, the staircase is very narrow and not convenient.

 · Очень уютный маленький отель, ощущение как будто ты живешь в семье. Действительно великолепное расположение в 1 минуте от станции метро, что очень удобно!
Персонал супер приветливый. На первом этаже расположено кафе, продают тортик пирожные, кофе чай и разные коктейли, все очень вкусно. 
В 3х минутах ходьбы есть знаменитый 7eleven и небольшой рынок рядом, еду купленную там можно спокойно поесть в кафе отеля. 
Номера чистые, кровать большая и удобная, матрас средней жесткости, белье и полотенца чистые. Вода горячая есть и нагревается достаточно быстро.
Отель превзошел ожидания, благодарна персоналу и всему что поспособствовали моему выбору!Disliked

 · Месторасположение относительно метро - замечательное. Буквально метров 50. Девушка дождалась нас, хоть приехали мы в 9 вечера. Предварительно я писала о времени прибытия и мне отвечали оперативно. Довольно аскетичное убранство, НО...очень чисто. Белоснежное хрустящее постельное, белоснежные полотенца. В Таиланде, в отелях много дороже, поискать еще такую чистоту белья надо. Слышимость, конечно, очень хорошая) надо сказать, что и деньги небольшие. Но чистота перекрывает все. Мешком можно ходить, метро под боком очень удобно. Надо сказать, что до аэропорта рано утром, когда нет много людей еще, дорога заняла чуть больше часа. Одна пересадка. Обозначено кафе на первом этаже, написано, что работает с 7.30. В 8.00 не было никого там, так что за утренним кофе пришлось ехать) в общем, понятно, что за эти деньги номеров люкс не приходится ожидать, но чистотой ситуация выравнивается. Думаю, более 2-3 ночей там невозможно изза шума уличного. А может, кто то спокойно переносит) шум бытовой, заведений с гулянками поблизости не видели.Disliked

 · Very modern, spotlessly clean, wonderful staff, great choice at breakfast, very nice pool & gym, nice coffee shop, short walk to both MRT & BTS and the biggest TV I've ever seen in a hotel room. We Loved the room mood lighting, & the shower was awesome. 
We initially chose this hotel only because it was central to 3 appointments my wife had to make in one day, but we ended up loving this hotel and due to the short walk to both the BTS & MRT we are definitely booking again.
Every member of staff was very polite and very helpful, thank you very much and we are back at the end of MarchDisliked

 · Staff was absolutely amazing - very friendly and helpful - salary raise for all of them, please! The bed was super comfy and the showerhead was awesome. The huge television had a Netflix option, super cool! The room was somewhat on the smaller side, but for me travelling alone it was perfect. Also the complementary toothbrush was also super nice - i took the 2nd one with me :|. I saw some people in other reviews complaining about breakfast - but i have to say the (non-asian)-options were great; fresh fruit, good coffee, bread, jam, honey, eggs. I didn't use the pool of the gym, so can't say anything about that. for me: all in all super-duper!Disliked
 · The only thing i noticed were spots on the bed sheets, and fingerprints on the doors - I'm not easily grossed out so it didn't really bother me - but i did notice it.

The rooms were very clean and equipped with a great bed, large smart TV with a crystal clear reception and a beautiful Phillips ambilight which illuminates the entire room and has a bunch of modes & lighting to choose from. The Bathroom is equipped with a rain shower, which I truly loved. All in all a great hotel in which the price- performance ratio is top! Mind the 2 little things which could have been better, this is a very good hotel and on my next trip thru Bangkok I will stay here again.Disliked
 · Only 2 things which weren't to my liking 1.was that the room didn't have alot of daylight.I mean it's not dark.. There is a window and There are plenty of lights to turn on, but in regards to pure daylight, for me personally I would've loved a little bit more due to the fact that I had to work on my laptop in my room. Second would be the pool. It's located in between the 2 towers so absolutely no sunshine on it at any time. But this is something you already see in the photos on booking so you know what to expect. These 2 factors are the only reason why I didn't give the full points on the review.",6,"The Quarter Silom by UHG - SHA Extra Plus

 · I think that the Quarter really knows how to get the vibe right at the hotel. The lighting is nice with these pink and blue neon accents. I am sitting here by the pool as I write this, eating the buffet breakfast. They have a selection of Thai dishes, fruits, salad, traditional breakfast foods, espresso drinks and half-cooked breads so that when you toast them they are fresh. The restaurant staff is nice and even tho it is a buffet, the lady working here comes to ask sure if I need anything at least as frequently as a restaurant. :) Nice place.",6,"The Quarter Silom by UHG - SHA Extra Plus

 · Stayed here for a few months and felt like a home away from home! This was in part due to the excellent staff who are always so kind, accommodating and attentive. Great facilities, an (almost) full equipped gym, sauna/steam-room and a nice spacious common area to work/hang out/eat.
Hotel is new, has comfortable bedding and a nice modern design. Room is always well maintained/clean and has good storage. 
Location is great! Just a few mins walk to the BTS, tucked away in a small soi away from the noise and close to a market for food options.Disliked
 · Western options for breakfast are rather lacking. The heating device used to maintain the warmth of the food perhaps needs improvement as the food is sometimes cold. Food could also be filled up more attentively. Staff should enforce more sanitary measure for COVID (e.g. gloves to be worn when getting food, covering veggies and fruits that are just left out). 
AC is turned off in the common area after breakfast so air is rather stagnant. However, a fan is always available upon request.",6,"The Quarter Silom by UHG - SHA Extra Plus

Rather spacious room - quiet and comfortable with nice amenities; great bathroom - serviced every day.
Excellent breakfast.
Absolutely lovely staff, super kind and helpful.
In these times of COVID19, the hotel does a perfect job. 
Overall and at this point in time (March / April 2021), it provides absolutely amazing value.
I am becoming familiar with ""Hotels"" by UHG and I must say that so far, they never disappointed.

Brand new hotel with great facilities (swimming pool, spa, fitness center) and a very comfortable room.

 · Location is convenient. Excellent breakfast, one of the better hotel's breakfasts during our stay in Thailand.Disliked
 · The bathroom was very dirty when we arrived and even on our special request to clean it again, they didn't do it. On the corridor floor, a few meters from our door, someone left dirty dinner dishes and it stayed there for three out of a total of four days we stayed in this hotel so, literally we had to jump over dirty plates every time we wanted to enter or leave our room. The key card was constantly failing to work and we had to change it literally 1-2 times a day, every day, for a new one in order to enter the room or use the elevator. The water in the swimming pool was extremely cold. During breakfast the air conditioning was always on, at a very low temperature and when we complained to the staff, they did nothing. We literally had to eat as quickly as possible in order to not frize. I think, this is a hotel strategy, to make guests to eat less food from buffet. Talking about the staff, they are extremely useless and lazy, and everyone tries to rob you at every step. We paid for the test&go package in this hotel. Although, we gave them almost 200EUR for package, they avoided to give us masks, antigen tests and disinfectants until the last day of our stay, although we repeatedly warned them that we did not get what we paid for and what they were obliged to provide us with at the check-in. Also, when we asked the staff at the reception to book for us a regular taxi for the tour, they tried to charge us 2 times the price. They also tried with the scam when we asked them to book for us a taxi from the hotel to the airport. At this time, they asked us for 50% more money at the top of an agreed price, for alleged toll on the highway, which we knew was a lie, so we booked a taxi by ourselves through the GRAB app.",6,"The Quarter Silom by UHG - SHA Extra Plus

 · The location was good for my needs and a short walk from Silom Road/BTS/MRT.Disliked
 · During check-in, the staff were very unfriendly. After I gave my passport and said I was checking in for 1 night, the receptionist didn't even reply with any words. The first words they did say was when they asked me to pay 500 baht deposit in case of room damage. I was then presented with a form to sign with the rules of the room and that I agreed to follow. 
In the room, the bed had further warnings of fines in case of breaking the rules. Overall, this made for the most unwelcoming experience I've ever had at a hotel. I will not be considering this hotel group again if this is their way of greeting their guests.

 · When everything was going well, when I went down to breakfast, I was met by a rude restaurant cashier with a fake smile and polite speaking. Although the breakfast is mainly Asian, it was nice and very cheap. Since I wanted to have my breakfast comfortably in my room, I asked the same attendant. Again, I was met with a surprising answer with the same attitude. No to me sir you have to finish your meal by 11 😳. It was 7 o'clock and he could only say such a thing with a bad thought. However, I was the one who finished my breakfast first and left the restaurant. After this attitude, I did not want to stay in that hotel any longer. When I finished my reservation, I went to the lobby. The lady attendant said she will check the house kipping room to return the deposit. After the house keeping returned, she made me sign the receipt with the deposit number on it. While I was waiting for my money, he told me that you smoked in the room. I said no too. The attendant smelled, she said. I said it's not possible. She told me to go upstairs and have a look together. I said yes too. Then I remembered the receipt I signed. i asked her what is it for. She said ok ok, i said not ok, tell me, she didn't answer just did go up act with hand. I said to my friend that I will leave my bags and we will go after that. Meanwhile, the breakfast clerk acted as if he was seeing a bag for the first time, and talked about me to someone else in a language that I did not understand, which is something more rude. After leaving my bags and returning, the bellboy handed me the deposit and said it's okay.",6,"The Quarter Silom by UHG - SHA Extra Plus

 · The best thing about this hotel are the staff - very welcoming, kind, speak fluent English and honest (unlike other hotels belong to this group). 
Mr. Tar and the lady at the reception were superb!
Shower was comfortable, good size, nice rain shower with good pressure. 
Bed mattress was fine. 
Location is great, quite considering it’s in the heart of Silom.Disliked
 · The balcony is useless really - tiny, narrow, no view. A mosquito net would be so appreciated - couldn’t open the balcony door (mosquitos and cockroaches danger). The room is very dark - curtains must be shut for privacy. 
Room wasn’t so clean nor fresh. Dust, hair in the sink. Bed sheets did not feel fresh nor good smell. 
Doors and walls are so thin, you can hear anything from outside your door. 
Some weird noises not sure if it’s the aircon or the minibar. 
I also didn’t like the lobby or sitting area if that what it is. Looks like it’s only for eating, not welcoming if you want to sit, chill, read or work. 
The hotel is currently under construction.
For the price and one night stay it was ok.",6,"The Quarter Silom by UHG - SHA Extra Plus

 · A brand new UHG hotel, located in Silom/Surawongse area with a direct Soi to Narashiwas rd. Very very fancy and tasteful. Staff all super friendly and try their best to accommodate your needs.

I also booked this place and paid the price for the rooftop only, managed to change to a normal room but it cost me almost as much, so extremely low value for money.
The whole house is a building site, I arrived during the day and wanted to nap to help with the jetlag, but it was impossible due to the drilling.

Met een reisgezelschap van 4 hadden wij 2 kamers geboekt. In de ene kamer liep het water uit de badkamer niet weg en kon de douchekop niet normaal in de houder blijven. In de andere kamer bleef de televisie haken op 1 zender. Verder kregen we maar 1 handdoek, maar toen we 1 extra vroegen kregen we die gelukkig wel!

 · Địa điểm tuyệt vời, chỉ cần đi khỏi hẻm ra đường chính là gặp ngay 2 trạm bus 2 hướng di chuyển, gần như các điểm tham quan, bus sân bay,... đều có bus đi qua đây, ko cần phải chuyển bus. Cách Khao san 10 phút đi bộ thôi, nên vừa gần KSan vừa ko bị ồn ào về đêm. Đặc biệt giường ở đây siêu siêu êm, view phòng mình nhìn ra chỉ thấy cây thôi nên buổi sáng rất trong lành. Chắc chắn sẽ book ở đây khi quay lại BK.
Great location, just go out of the alley to the main road is to meet 2 bus stations 2 directions of travel, almost place to visit (wat pho, wat arun, grand, chinatown,siam,...), airport bus, ... all have buses going through here, no need to transfer buses . The way of Khao san is a 10-minute walk and isn't noisy at night. Especially, the bed is super super smooth. The view from my room only see the tree but the morning is very fresh.

 · Прекрасный номер, с отличным видом на город. Очень тихо, шум с улицы не слышно, так как отель расположен в 100 метрах от улицы. Рядом находится пирс, от которого можно добраться до бизнес центра города. Сам отель чистый и современный. Круглосуточные снэки , чай, кофе на ресепшн. Сам номер Люкс очень маленький, нет шкафа, есть кровать, сейф, телевизор, холодильник и вешалка. Но есть прекрасная веранда, на которой можно приятно отдохнуть после прогулок по городу. Потрясающий душ на улице, собственно туалет там же :) но очень необычно и понравилось. Персонал очень приятный, ежедневная уборка, правда наверно надо напомнить персоналу, что надо убраться. Метро совсем не рядом, поэтому следует учесть это. Но мы пользовались часто crab taxi - недорого и удобно. В целом очень рекомендую данный отель, особенно с номером ЛюксDisliked

 · C'est un hôtel que je recommande à Bangkok situé dans une petite ruelle, bien au calme, non loin de la fameuse ""Kaosan Road"" , c'est vraiment en plus, De plus nous avons été très bien accueillis par les réceptionnistes très souriantes et avenantes, accueil convivial et familiale très bon esprit, cet hôtel à compris les attentes des occidentaux, de plus le petit déjeuner est offert, et la literie est vraiment très agréables, rare en Thaïlande ...Disliked

 · Фото ну прям как инста😁 ожидание и реальность 😁 вообще не понял, что это было, говорил друзьям, вот типа снял номер на крыше 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻😁 Тут кто-то писал про романтик)))) ну для 18 лет наверное это романтик 😂 и если вы не сходите на 1 этаж, на улицу выкинуть предметы своего романтика (я имею ввиду остатки продуктов))), то ждите в последующие дни много друзей😂 Единственный плюс, вы близко ко всем достопримечательностям!! Не берите люксы на верхних этажах, это не люксы, это бог знает что)))) скворечником ито не назовёшь,вокруг кровати дай бог 0,8 метра от стены))) мелкие муравьи и прочая х-нь, хорошо не кусаются, кроме Комаров)) Всё грязно ( это я именно про номер на крыше), кроме постели))) белья)) все краны текут, шкафов нет)), в зеркало вы будете себя видеть только днём))) прям антивампир))) в самом отеле чисто, холл, лестницы. И я так понял, надо обязательно попросить, чтоб у тебя убрали в номере))) Персонал заходил, но походу только, чтобы проверить, что скворечник не сгорел 😁Остальные номера вроде нормальные, краем глаза видел. Не знаю как там с живностью)) Сейчас в Куала-Лумпур в ibis, за те-же деньги с видом на петронасы 😏, небо и земля. И если честно, я вообще не врубился за что такая цена, походу за центр, и за то, что я был там на Новый год) Не знаю, хорошая задумка, почему не сделать всё нормально, деревья, лежак, всё переделать, убираться, и будет классно) а так конечно ахтунг.

 · La habitación aunque es pequeña es super agradable, todo muy limpio y bien cuidado, tenía todo lo esperado, toallas, cepillo de dientes, secador, etc. El personal super amable y la ubicación muy buena, además el desayuno era muy rico, con varias opciones para escoger y se puede tomar desde muy temprano en la mañana para asi poder salir a hacer los tours.Show translation",4,"Sawasdee House

 · Zum Einchecken will das Hostel 50 Dollar Pfand. Direkt nach dem Einchecken fanden wir eine Liste, mit Preisen die wir im Falle von Beschädigung zu zahlen hätten.

 · El precio no encaja con el nivel de las instalaciones, quizás esperábamos algo más nuevo. El wifi no funcionaba, después de reclamar nos dieron una solución, lo que se agradece. El desayuno tampoco era gran cosa y Sólo había un par de opciones a elegir. Al tener un restaurante y bar de copas en la planta baja el ruido llegaba a las habitaciones hasta más de la 1 de la madrugada que es cuando empiezan a cerrar. Quizás no lo recomendaría sobre todo porqué cerca existen otras opciones que cuandran más en calidad-precio.Show translation",4,"Sawasdee House

 · The staff was very helpful and nice. They offer some free drinks and there is a coffee shop where you can order coffee, tea or any other drinks. It is located near metro station (less than 3 min walk).Disliked
 · Beds are awful! They are toooo hard without any real mattresses. Like sleeping on the stone or timber. It is very uncomfortable to sleep in their beds. 
The washroom is full of ants 🐜. The bathroom is super small and smelly. 
There is one annoying regulation which is forced you to take off your shoes before entering the hotel and use the provided slippers which is very disgusting. You have to use the public slippers, it is not acceptable at all. In addition, the staircase is very narrow and not convenient.

 · Очень уютный маленький отель, ощущение как будто ты живешь в семье. Действительно великолепное расположение в 1 минуте от станции метро, что очень удобно!
Персонал супер приветливый. На первом этаже расположено кафе, продают тортик пирожные, кофе чай и разные коктейли, все очень вкусно. 
В 3х минутах ходьбы есть знаменитый 7eleven и небольшой рынок рядом, еду купленную там можно спокойно поесть в кафе отеля. 
Номера чистые, кровать большая и удобная, матрас средней жесткости, белье и полотенца чистые. Вода горячая есть и нагревается достаточно быстро.
Отель превзошел ожидания, благодарна персоналу и всему что поспособствовали моему выбору!Disliked

 · Месторасположение относительно метро - замечательное. Буквально метров 50. Девушка дождалась нас, хоть приехали мы в 9 вечера. Предварительно я писала о времени прибытия и мне отвечали оперативно. Довольно аскетичное убранство, НО...очень чисто. Белоснежное хрустящее постельное, белоснежные полотенца. В Таиланде, в отелях много дороже, поискать еще такую чистоту белья надо. Слышимость, конечно, очень хорошая) надо сказать, что и деньги небольшие. Но чистота перекрывает все. Мешком можно ходить, метро под боком очень удобно. Надо сказать, что до аэропорта рано утром, когда нет много людей еще, дорога заняла чуть больше часа. Одна пересадка. Обозначено кафе на первом этаже, написано, что работает с 7.30. В 8.00 не было никого там, так что за утренним кофе пришлось ехать) в общем, понятно, что за эти деньги номеров люкс не приходится ожидать, но чистотой ситуация выравнивается. Думаю, более 2-3 ночей там невозможно изза шума уличного. А может, кто то спокойно переносит) шум бытовой, заведений с гулянками поблизости не видели.Disliked

 · We arrived at 2pm and were presented with a list of strict house keeping rules, which included check in and out times.
After being asked for a signature of agreement, we were the told our room would not be ready for another 20-30 minutes, although the rules we had signed for stated check in at 2pm
Although the rooms are fairly cheap, they are not good value for money. The rooms are not clean, there are several marks on the walls, stains and cracks in the walls and floors. Our toilet was blocked and leaking.
We reported this to the manager on duty, who began to almost tell us of saying that we should not flush tissue in the toilet, although there were no signs informing of this.
The manager did not apologise or even attempt to change our room after reporting the leaking toilet, but very quickly informed that we would need to pay 300 bahts extra to upgrade.

The hotel staff was lovely and the room was clean and bright. The A/C was very good and a lovely hot shower. There were reading lights on the headboard and plugs and switches near the bed. The room had a wardrobe, flat screen TV. mini fridge and a safety locker. For the price I paid I could not have asked for more. It’s a short walk to the BTS (On Nut). There is a 7/11 and a laundry nearby and a food court a few steps away from the hotel. The hotel provides a free Tuk Tuk ride to the station. This place is run very professionally by the two ladies at the reception. I was sad to leave and would be staying at this hotel on my visits to Bangkok.Disliked

 · I am sure there is nothing worth mentioning about this hotel positivelyDisliked
 · The moment I landed I saw that only one receptionist who said no bellboy to carry luggage so I carried my luggage myself that too next building of the hotel.Then she showed me the room which was a corner room 2506 where Wifi does not work .They misguide is saying free tuk tuk drop from hotel but they ask us to go by bikes by paying the amount.No room service and horrible breakfast that I went out and had breakfast at another hotel..So I sum up that this was a terrible experience for me",8,"Solo Express Sukhumvit 81

 · The rooms were relatively clean, but that’s because they were as bare as a hospital room!Disliked
 · Where do I begin. Let’s start with the location, which is dodgy, tucked away inside a side road and very difficult to access public transport from. 
Secondly, I had booked 2 executive king sized rooms. On arrival we were told this was not available, even though I was paying extra for these rooms and were shown 2 rooms that looked like they belonged to a brothel! On kicking up a fuss we were then shown to two slightly better rooms. My sister and brother in law stayed in a room next to us and they had the most horrific experience of their lives. The toilet repeatedly got flooded and ultimately overflowed !!!!!!!!! Their safe stopped working so they had to borrow ours. The breakfast gave us a dodgy tummy. A fight broke out outside the rooms in the early hours of the morning. And the rooms smell of a strong disinfectant, like a hospital!!! The list is long and I still feel drained from it stay. This place would be good value for money for backpackers, but definitely not for a family.
We are still distressed by our experience.",8,"Solo Express Sukhumvit 81

I enjoyed the stay a lot, only thing Fan was not there in rooms (I feel its must for rooms because of humidity). They had Tuk Tuk where you can drop off at the Main road or Metro.

 · Тихий и спокойный отель. Не далеко находится BNS On NUT, до которого можно дойти пешком, а можно поймать мотобайк и за 10 б. добраться до bts. Также возле bts огромный Tesco lotus и множество кафешек, ресторанчиков и Buffet. Район очень живой, много иностранцев.
Ресепшен просто отличный, всегда подскажут и помогут!
Номера просторные, очень чистые. Мне очень нравится, что проводят ежедневную уборку, со сменой постельного белья и полотенец, ежедневно приносят 2 бутылочки воды.
Отличный интернет.
Номера чуть старые, поэтому не пугайтесь расползающегося ламината и мелких недочетов. Все это перекрывает обслуживание, чистые и светлые номера.

 · The location is great as it's just around the corner from Soi Aree and the bts. The room was nicely decorated and we liked the hotel bars and pool area.Disliked
 · The room was quite small for two people providing little space for us to open our luggage. There was a balcony too but again that was tiny. We found the staff to be quite unhelpful at times. For example, they were reluctant to allow us into the bar areas and despite the room being empty wouldn't let us check-in on arrival even though it was 1pm. We would therefore not choose this hotel again.",10,"Josh Hotel

 · Josh Hotel is a gem. The look is vintage and does a great job of that experience. As an adult, the restaurant was chic. The pool is a lovely have as some places don't have one. The rooms were comfy. Such good value for money, we had breakfast included too! 
 Tea and coffee was available outside the room at a little station. I loved that idea. Thank you.
 The breakfast menu was small, but wonderful. Coffee and my daughter's chocolate iced drink were amazing.
 I would like the Josh, also my son's name 😁 to take into consideration that one place doesn't fit all people. We did have a lovely stay.Disliked
 · This is only if you have children with you otherwise I wouldn't put this. Please take note of that. 
 The menu was lovely, but if you have kids, it could be hard. In the evening the restaurant was beautiful, again I couldn't see children there. Maybe that's just my option. 
 I have said breakfast was amazing and it was for adults and my older daughter, but not so much for my younger son. Though he found the bacon better than I do at home 😂
 I hope my negatives are taken with only our experience of having children with us, our kids.
 Overall. A lovely place.",10,"Josh Hotel

 · The hotel is situated in quite a cool, quirky looking area of Bangkok. It is a really nice hotel but as a travelling couple I wouldn't necessarily recommend it, I think it would be much better suited for business travellers. The interiors of the hotel were lovely, and the pool looked nice too (we were only staying for one night so didn't make much use of the facilities). We did dine in the Marigold restaurant on the ground floor of the hotel in the evening, which was a little bit pricey but the food was delicious and presented really well. We also visited the hotel's bar 'The Key' Room No.72 and enjoyed some really lovely (but expensive) cocktails. The bar was really cool though, I would definitely recommend going and enjoying a drink there.Disliked
 · The staff on reception were nice enough, but this was the first hotel we had stayed at in Thailand that didn't show us the facilities, or to our room. Once we had checked in, we were left to find our room by ourselves (in the very small elevator) - which usually I wouldn't mind, but for the price we had paid, I expected a little more helpfulness from the staff. We stayed in a deluxe room, it felt very small, and there were no tea/coffee making facilities were in the room, they were situated just outside in the corridor for communal use. It was a nice hotel, but I wouldn't advise staying there for a long period of time.",10,"Josh Hotel

Mural paintings scared the hell out of me a couple of times because at the water refill station is a mirror. Looks like someone is standing behind me. Haha. 
Only downfall is the size of the room. We brought a medium and large luggage. No space to walk around once the luggage’s are open. Quite uncomfortable to skirt around them to move in the room.

8. WiFi is awful. Every time you leave you’re phone untouched for a minute it logs out and you have to go through everything again. Though complained and got a new password it didn’t work.

 · The location was near a BTS. Far from the usual tourist spots but has enough restaurant nearby.Disliked
 · +Rooms are very noisy. You can hear everyone in the hallway when they open the doors or just laugh. Since there are restaurant and bars nearby, many guests go in and out until 3am. At 6am, the neighbor's dog will bark incessantly. Rooms are not soundproof.
+Decor only looks nice in pictures. It is much more dated in reality. 
+The room is very hot without a key. Also room will not have electricity without leaving your key card. I had to get an extra keycard which needs a 500THB deposit to leave in the room to activate aircon. Walking around in hot Bangkok and coming home to a muggy room is not a good experience. It feels like a sauna without the keycard. Takes a while for the room to get cold.
+Towels are old and thin. Shower was also leaking the whole night leaving a small corner of the bathroom wet the whole time.
+Bed is quite hard like a rock. Did not get any sleep despite traveling for 24 hours due to noise and bed. 
+Staff is not helpful. I complained about the noise and wanted to leave after one night. Staff didn't pay attention to my requests or offer to move me. I told them on the first night that I wanted to change rooms or leave. I was willing to pay for the first night but wanted a refund on my second. Staff pretended at first not to understand and claim it was booking.com fault. Called Booking.com who solved my problems but hotel still didn't want to give a refund. Booking.com just gave me some credit in the end. Didn't sleep at all the first night and just did this during the wee hours of the morning since the hotel was so noisy with the guests and the barking dog. Horrible experience. 
+Not a four star hotel. Borrowing an umbrella requires another deposit. It was also just a staff's umbrella.
+Decided to change hotels after one night even if I paid for two. Other places in Bangkok are so much better.",10,"Josh Hotel

She didn’t even put the dishes from breakfast-in-bed away for us. The bathroom in family-room didn’t have a place to hang our clothes.

 · La struttura è molto accogliente, design in stile Wes Anderson, ristorante/bar della piscina, negozio di vestiti tutto molto curato nel medesimo stile. Colazioni ottime.

整體是間很新很設計感的旅店
真心認為比較適合情侶入住
然後泳池的部分蠻不錯
雖然不˙大但還是可以玩得很開心
還有很多網美會狂拍個半小時
就算不游泳還是能躺在泳池旁的躺椅
看到很多用心拍照打卡的女生
還有一位用心幫女友拍照的另一半
最厲害的是還看到一位網美
穿著毛衣在泳池拍照
對於曼谷差不多34度左右的高溫
讓泡在水裡的我不禁讚嘆起來
她們真的用生命在拍照
我也體會到了
附近還有很多好吃的小店
算是Ari站蠻不錯的優點Disliked
 · 一開始進房的時候就有股屎味
結果發現是廁所裡傳來的
跟櫃檯人員反應後才派人來打掃
結果也只是刷刷地噴噴空氣清新劑
雖然是蓋掉了至少80%原本的屎味
但一進房間就聞到屎味的觀感
差不多已經被扣了80分以上
希望大家進房先檢查一下廁所Show translation",10,"Josh Hotel

저는 잠만 잘 생각으로 고른 호텔이라 전반적으로 괜찮았습니다. 하지만 확실히 방카피가 외곽 지역이라 시내로 나가려면 오토바이로 30분은 걸리니 시내에서 노실 분들은 여기서 숙소 잡는건 비추합니다.Show translation",13,"Vabua Asotel Bangkok

 · J ai eu une chambre sale. Fourmis sur le plateau de la chambre, rideaux de chambres sale plein de grosse tache, les draps blancs avaient des taches , le meuble de lit poussiéreux, balcon sale, SDB sale surtout le lave main et la barre pour sécher serviette). En plus en cadeau on a eu 2 cafards. La chambre sentait le renfermé.
Les cafards etaient de trop Ils nous ont changé de chambre quand on s est plein. Le WC de la SDB dans la nouvelle chambre sale. Ca ce voyait que le résident d avant etait un.homme, il y avait des traces de pipi collé sur le bord du WC on leur a demandé de nettoyer tout de suite. Je n i rais plus jamais dans cette hotel. Ca ce dit 3 étoiles mais ce n est pas le cas. Je pense le standard de 3 étoiles ici est 1 étoile en France. Peut importe le standard un minimum de propreté est nécessaire. Essuyer le sol de la chambre uniquement n est pas un ménage. Surtout quand Quelqun est passé juste avant.
Je ne conseil cette hotel a personne.Show translation",13,"Vabua Asotel Bangkok

 · Staff in particular were attentive, responsive and looked after us very well. The hotel room was very clean and the executive lounge was very quiet, comfortable and had excellent food and drinks. One important point was the Covid precautions were just right, not overdone like in so many other places.Disliked

 · Complying with Covid restrictions, especially in Thailand, is not an easy task for a hotel. The Kempinski does an excellent job of of ensuring that whilst 
strictly complying with all the government ""safety"" measures, the famous Kempinski service and attention to detail is compromised as little as possible.Disliked
 · Not entirely the hotel's fault, but the service at breakfast, because the buffet its not operating, because of ""safety"" measures is not optimal. Also, the gym is closed.",14,"Siam Kempinski Hotel Bangkok - SHA Extra Plus Certified

The stuff is extremely attentive and friendly, especially Somyos at the pool restaurant was gorgeous and caring like a mother ☺️ thanks! The breakfast is extraordinarily good with everything you can think of and again, very attentive stuff! The friendly hotel manager from Norway keeps a good eye on everything and is very supportive. „Consider it as done“ seems to be his motto.

The hotel was very accomdating when our airline made a last minute, unexpected schedule change on our return flight, allowing us to return to our room after we had checked out and quiclkly provided us with a seamless and fair extension of our stay.
We highly recommend the Siam Kempinski, and would rebook in a heartbeat.Disliked

 · On my vacations I usually stays in 5 starts hotels 
And this hotel exceeded my expectations in compare to other 5 starts hotel I have bean to.
I stayed in the past in other hotels in Bangkok such as in shangrila, but this hotel had that extra touch.
Lets start by saying it’s not yours usual Bangkok luxury hotel; the hotel is a circle of buildings around peaceful garden and pools, creating a small sanctuary in the middle of the city hassle and noise.
The location of the hotel is superb just near Siam center, surrendered by shopping malls and lots of restaurants (except the ones inside the hotel)
They cleaned the room twice a day, especially I liked the stuff at the pool bar, grate service with a smile and willing to provide good service.
The rooms designed with style, and a porch overlooking the garden and pools was great
I think I found my permanent staying place in Bangkok for future travels.Disliked

It is lovely to have the relaxing big pool area that is an oasis of peace and tranquility from the hustle and bustle out side in the city streets.
It is perfectly situated with access directly into the Paragon Siam Mall and for the BTS .

 · The Siam Kempinski was perfect in so many ways, but mostly it was perfect in what was most delicious important to us. Location is ideal, the hotel decor and grounds are exquisite and so inviting, rooms are well appointed and beds comfortable, but, most importantly, the welcoming staff and their attentive service make this a place you look forward to returning to after a day in the hustle and bustle of this amazing city! We would like to make a special note to mention our first encounter during check in with Ms. Rungaroon set the tone for our 5 night stay. Her polite demeanor and outstanding customer service, combined with the wonderful Thai warmth and hospitality, truly made our arrival at Siam Kempinski memorable. She then offered us an upgrade which made the stay all the more enjoyable! All these wonderful encounters and the attention to detail (too many to list!) make this THE ONLY place to stay!Disliked

 · The hotel did not provide us information that we can take the buggie to Siam Station when we checked in.
We found out later when we asked the staff for the direction to the station before the footbridge to the shopping mall was opened.
Also the cleaning of room was not prompt as expected
When we left the room around 10am we turned on the makeup room sign but the room was still not cleaned until 3pm. But seems like it was the full house so thats probably why. Despite these, very satisfied with the stay.",14,"Siam Kempinski Hotel Bangkok - SHA Extra Plus Certified

 · This was the perfect for what I was looking for. I needed to work from home, but wanted a place to cook and make myself at home so to speak. I enjoyed having the full size refrigerator, full kitchen stocked with plates, cutlery and cookware and utensils. I loved that it still had a hotel feel to it as I didn't have to do any of the washing up and the lovely cleaners did so for me each day. The bed was comfy and the area is great for getting dinners nearby or popping out for coffee breaks. The pool was calm and the gym was quiet as well. Really lovely stay while working.",16,"Aspira Tropical Residence Thong Lor - SHA Certified

 · Me and my family have lived in this hotel for over one week now. Except for the WIFI, we are satisfied with everything else. Staffs are very very friendly, we felt welcomed. We think location is not a big problem for long stay customers like us. Actually we love the peaceful environment, not noisy at all.Disliked
 · The WiFi provided in this hotel is not good enough. Not always stable. Definitely need to be improved. Also, it would be nice if the hotel could provide discount price for long stay customers. We are going to extend our booking for another week. We tried to contact the hotel and get discounted price. But the reception staff said the “best price” is already on booking.

We slept amazingly while we were there. We also liked that we were able to watch cable TV. Although not in the city centre we really liked the area. It was about 10-15 mins to everything. Great place to stay.Disliked
 · The closest is about a 20-25 min walk. Not a big deal but we did a lot of cooking so it was a bit of a pain waiting for housekeeping to clean up just once a day so we eventually went and got our own washing up stuff.

Also the room were not really cleaned above all the living room end the dining table.
The provided pans cannot be used because already scratched (Teflon paint is toxic).
If you have small child make sure properly lock the terrace door because the terrace is not safe for the child (they can easily pass by the spaces or climb the wall terrace like steps).

 · The staff was very friendly and helpful. Although we we're disappointed in the beginning the front desk staff helped us find a room that was more suitable for us. Cleaning service was very thorough and the layout was pretty good for such a small space. Based on other reviews I thought the location would've been better, but it is still a good area and great if you're needing to visist Samitivej Hospital.Disliked
 · The wifi was terrible. In our first room we had to call 4-5 times a day for the router to be reset. They said they were having it fixed, but even after, it would connect, but the connection was so slow that we could not use it. The hotel did move us to a room they said would have better wifi and it did (slightly), however, any important work still had to be done in the common room as the connection was too poor inside the room.
The first room we were in was not comfortable as the flooring was lifting up at the edge of every peice of flooring so it would poke us and scratch our kids. Also I would not recommend if you have young kids as the bathtub is awkwardly high and it's hard for kids to get in and out of safely. 
We also wished that the hotel car/tuk tuk would be available to go to the main street at any time. They have a schedule of every hour and a half, but it was quite hard to keep to their schedule with kids. It would have been helpful to be able to get dropped off on the main road, especially when you see the car/tuk tuk just sitting in the parking lot. 
The gym was small, but had good amount of items. Treadmill was broken the first few days, but then was fixed for the last couple days of our stay. I would recommend that the hotel provide small towels for the gym or that you're more prepared than me and bring your own :)",16,"Aspira Tropical Residence Thong Lor - SHA Certified

 · Все новое, очень удобная кровать, идеально белые полотенца, которые меняют каждый день, уборка так же каждый день. Находится на тихой улице. К качеству самих апартаментов вопросов нет.Disliked
 · Очень далеко от всего. До ближайшего магазина далеко, до станции BTS ещё дальше. Есть шаттл бас, но он не курсирует, сотрудники отеля вызывают «маршрутку», это даже не тук-тук, это полу грузовичок, где вы сидите в кузове практически на полу. И все равно до метро долго, т.к на улицах вокруг всегда пробки. Обратно доехать ещё сложнее, т.к водители этих маршруток у метро не понимают куда вам надо (адрес на визитке отеля им ни о чем не говорит).
Мы букировали номер с балконом и видом (а ещё там должна быть стиральная машинка), дали номер без машинки, без балкона, с видом на стену (эти номера стоят дешевле). Попросили поменять, оказалось, что все номера на верхних этажах заняты постояльцами с долгосрочной арендой (так что не рассчитывайте на вид), можно было выбрать либо номер с балконом, либо там где есть машинка (почему нас изначально поселили вообще без всего - загадка). Имейте это ввиду и пишите запрос заранее, если вам важно наличие стиральной машины.Show translation",16,"Aspira Tropical Residence Thong Lor - SHA Certified

 · The staff was very friendly and my wish for a room with balcony was granted with a small upgrade.
The rooftop pool was very nice as well and had a nice view around Bangkok. 
The location was a little tricky to find with taxi, but in exchange the stay was very quiet.
The breakfast was great too and a good value for the extra cost, it was mixed to cater to Western and Korean guests.Disliked
 · The only thing I could think of was, that the ash tray on the balcony never got emptied, so I had to improvise an ash tray from a soda can and in the bath room you could sometimes hear other, more noisy guests.",19,"Arte Hotel - SHA Extra Plus

 · We had a very warm welcome from their staff, and the welcome drinks were really good! If anything, the best aspect of the hotel is the wonderful front desk and restaurant staff.
Our room was very nice, looks just as it does on the photos, and we definitely had a comfortable stay throughout our 5-day stay. The bath, shower, heater, TV, and mini-pantry were all fully functional and we didn't have problems with any appliances whatsoever.
The breakfast buffet was wonderful and there was a nice variety to the available food. The menu could be a bit repetitive for longer stays, but it wasn't a problem for us at all.
The pool and bar were just wonderful. They seem very well maintained, and the pool water was very clear with a beautiful view day and night. We didn't have time to try out the gym, but it seems sufficiently equipped nonetheless.
Overall, it was a wonderful stay. We would definitely recommend this place! :)Disliked
 · Our room was generally clean, but it was starting to show its age here and there. Either it might not have been perfectly maintained, or it's very likely that previous guests had just been extremely destructive to the property. The motorized bathroom curtain didn't work properly, and the sliding door to our bathroom wouldn't lock at all. There were weird creepy smudges of orange dirt on the ceiling (how did that even get there??) which proved just how irresponsible other people can be. The mirror light in the bathroom didn't work as well. It would have also been great if the windows were wiped down completely, as the views were beautiful if not only for the muddy glass. All these didn't take away much from our experience though, just some slight suggestions and room for improvement.
The wifi was unfortunately unusable and unnecessarily too complex. It would have been great if there was a simpler way to connect to the network instead of having to go through a proxied sign in page, but it is what it is. We also get disconnected quite often, and it was generally more reliable to just connect through a local 4G sim card. This could be a frustrating point for travelers, especially those that need to research their destination but isn't able to get a 4G sim card.",19,"Arte Hotel - SHA Extra Plus

 · Hard to turn on and adjust the shower until going in and being immersed into it. Took a long time for hot water to be ready (meanwhile, not being sure which direction was hot vs cold).
I wished the room lighting controls were easier to figure out and find. Kind of harsh lighting at the bed area, no soft warm light or dimmers. My only complaint about breakfast was, all the food at the buffet which is normally served warm, was totally cold (except the newly-made omelet).

 · I really liked the design of the Hotel. It's calming and modern. And I absolutly loved the scent of Jasmine everywhere!! The staff was very nice and they are very child friendly. The breakfast buffet was very nice they had a bunch of different bread and also the asian type breakfast (noodles/rice). At the main entrence in the small pool they have 3 Koi fishes, 1 turtle and a lot of small fishes.Disliked
 · It was not as I expected to be that clean as the ratings here are saying... The shower glass was still dirty from the water and the shower itself, bath mirror was streaky, the cabinet under the sink was stained, the light switches had dirty dust on it and the most uncomfortable were the bed sheets they had a pen stain and smelled not so nice. The rooms are very poorly soundproofed so you hear almost everything. The carpets in the hallway and elevator were dirty. The pool is okey/good. The glasses were dirty and the pool is very slippery. (The night lighting on the rooftop and pool are very cool!)
And I had booked 3 nights but we stayed 2 and wanted a late check out that I asked on mail before we arrived. On the desk they did not approve it so we had to pay for 3 nights.. Not cool!",19,"Arte Hotel - SHA Extra Plus

 · The location was ok, near the skytrain, although the street was full of cockroaches and rats at night.
The porters were very friendly.
The swimming pool was a plus although there was no control over it as a result lots of people drank beer in it, used enormous water toys and treated it as a playground for children.Disliked
 · The room was mouldy and terribly wet, the beds were wet, the floor, the towels wouldn't dry, the floor was very slippery. When we asked the receptionist for a change she said she didn't have any other rooms so to fix the problem we couldn't keep the temperature of 22 degrees in the room, we had to keep 20 degrees and that would do the trick. It didn't. She sent in a guy with a mop... It was ridiculous.
The walls were grey with mould, the air conditioning panel was all black dirty and mouldy. The stench in the room was unbearable, we had to buy tons of candles and electric air fresheners both for the room and the bathroom.
The hotel used to be nice but now it's just old, dirty, used and disgusting. It was the worst hotel I had during my stay in Thailand.

 · Great location, being an easy walk from both the skytrain and metro, loads of restaurants, shops etc., and yet still nice and quiet.

 · Albergo non troppo grande, se paragonato ai colossi di Bangkok, ma molto carino. E' la seconda volta che veniamo qui, non costa troppo, ha una bellissima terrazza con piscina a sfioro, e le stanze sono veramente belle, e cosa importante, la struttura è molta vicina alla fermata dello SkyTrain, quindi strategico per poter andare dove si vuole a Bangkok.
Ha una palestra e un ottimo ristorante. Noi prendiamo sempre pernottamento con la prima colazione, sempre molto ben fornita e appetitosa, che ci da la carica per quasi tutta la giornata, e poi in giro per la città fino a sera. In effetti in albergo si stà proprio poco, giusto la colazione del mattino e a volte la sera con aperitivo in piscina.
Dall'aereoporto ci vuole circa mezz'ora di taxi.Disliked
 · Il posto merita sempre, forse quest'anno l'abbiamo trovato un pò giù di tono, un pò lasciato andare, le pareti dei corridoi non tinteggiati da un pò, e altri piccoli particolari che comunque si fanno notare.

 · The hotel is awesome. The room service, the comfort, the style, the facilities, and the room were all perfect. I loved the view, and the rooftop bar and pool are a true gem. I needed to order food and everything was very smooth and easy. The bathroom is also stunning. Location is amazingDisliked
 · A few minor points:
The blanket is too thick and hot. You cannot open the window, so the only option is to dry yourself with the AC. This was actually uncomfortable. However, I asked for extra sheets so I can use them as a blanket, they provided and it was great. 
The pool closes quite early, and the rooftop bar closes very early!!!! (during weekdays), and during weekends it is open until 10 pm. The lobby doesn't have too much of nice facilities to hang out. 
The was very bad smell from the toilet all the time!!!! That was the worst part in the stay, that I would say have to be fixed:(",21,"Mercure Bangkok Sukhumvit 24 - SHA Extra Plus

 · Everything was quite good and staffs were helpful. Breakfast tasted good and quantity is sufficient.Disliked
 · Breakfast variety is really limited and understandably so due to the lockdown in place.
one major issue I faced was that when I asked for more coffee during the breakfast timing, I was informed by the restaurant staff that I could not ask for than 6 cups in total a day for 4 of us. So the story was that we had to go to the restaurant to collect our breakfast to eat in the room since dining in was not allowed. The coffee comes in very small disposable cups and I asked for 2 extras when I collected my breakfast for 4 of us - so total of 6 cups. On the fist day, one of the male staffs told me that if I need more coffee, I could come down to the restaurant to get more before 1030am. I was very happy since we really needed coffee in the morning. So i started to just get back to restaurant to get 2 more cups after we finished our breakfast in the room. So in total for the first 3-4 days, we were getting a total of 8 cups (2 each) for 4 of us, and mind you that these were very small cups (maybe around 120ml each). On the 5th day or so, one of the lady staffs (I believe she is more senior than the male staff) turned nasty (we were masked up so I could see the eyes and the way she spoke) and told me that I could not take more than 6 cups per morning and they could only provide me with 6 cups for 4 of us in the morning when i collect my breakfast. I was shocked when this happened. In the first place when I booked for the hotel, it was supposed to come with a buffet breakfast and means if there is dining in, I would definitely help myself with more coffee. I have no issue in going out to get the coffee outside (nothing is opened in the hotel due to the lock down) but I had to change and walk 10 mins out to get it. I was really turned off by this incident and this really put a bad taste to the entire stay.",21,"Mercure Bangkok Sukhumvit 24 - SHA Extra Plus

 · Too many people. It's a tourist hotel, so there's a lot of people, I'll not recommend it if you're intending to go for some quiet time.
The lifts works really oddly. Because I self drive, I cannot go to the car park directly from my room, need to go to lobby then change the lift. which is weird. I think the life system for car park can be done better.

 · Super locatie, de skytrain ligt om de hoek. 
Hiermee doorkruis je Bangkok op de meest eenvoudige en snelste manier.
Verder vonden we de rooftop van het hotel een geweldige plek om even bij te komen als je uit de stad kwam!
Ik zou hier zeker weer terugkomen.

 · 2. Mal im Hotel, erneut Zimmer 2321.
Diesmal ohne Frühstück, da beim letzten Mal vorab gesagt wurde, dass wir eine gute Auswahl an pflanzlichen/veganen Angeboten finden würden und das war einfach gelogen. Daher diesmal Frühstück = Restaurants um die Ecke wie Juicery, Veganerie, Broccoli Recolution… oder eben per Grab bestellt.
Tolle Lage, gute Pool Area (aber nur 4 Liegen und ab Mittag meist keine frischen Handtücher mehr vorhanden und Pool Bar immer geschlossen).
An für sich mögen wie das Hotel gerne, aber diesmal… siehe negative Punkte.Disliked
 · Diesmal erneut soweit alles sauber, aber einige Flecken auf dem Sessel und extremer Geruch, fast schon Gestank im Bad, vor allem Dusche (aus dem Abfluss). Roch nach „Kot“, um es milde zu sagen.
Reaktion von der Rezeption: keine Änderung, keine große Reinigung (das Zimmermädchen kann dran ja nichts ändern und sie waren sehr nett) und kein neues Zimmer.
Also 10 Tage im „Stinkezimmer“. Sollten wir nochmals ins Mercure 24 reisen, dann zu 100% in ein anderes Zimmer. Eigentlich schade, da wir es sehr mochten.
Generell war die Rezeption diesmal recht unfreundlich und langsam.
1. 3 Tage immer nur dünnes, kleines und billiges Klopapier. Reichte nie für 1 ganzen Tag.
Somit mussten wir meist am Abend neues Papier an der Rezeption erfragen. 2x dauerte es über 1. Stunde, obwohl ich beim 2. mal nachfragen nach über 30 Minuten gesagt hatte, dass meine Frau auf der Toilette sitzt und wir nun Klopapier brauchen. Ok kommt sofort bedeutete dann weitere 35 Min warten.
Habe dann eine Rolle aus einer öffentlichen Toilette im Hotel geholt. Echt schade sowas…
Auch sonst war die Rezeption diesmal recht unfreundlich. Kein Lächeln kam zurück, keine Erklärungen zu Problemen oder dem Hotel beim Check-In (Gym war nämlich den halben Tag nicht benutztbar, da dort Arbeiten unternommen wurden) usw.
Auch beim Check out keine Frage wie es diesmal war, kein „Have a nice day“ oder oder oder…
Daher keine Ahnung, ob wir nochmals kommen würden. :(yShow translation",21,"Mercure Bangkok Sukhumvit 24 - SHA Extra Plus

 · The Grande Center Pointe Hotel actually surprised me.
It was better than I anticipated.
The room was super clean and modern. 
The price was lower than any of the surrounding five-star hotels in the area. Great value!
The breakfast buffet always had a great selection and the cooks would accommodate personal requests.
The staff I encountered was extremely helpful and friendly.
Sasita was my receptionist. I relied on her for any questions or assistance I needed.
The location is one of the hotel's best assets.
Next to the BTS, close to shopping malls, and multiple entertainment venues.Disliked
 · My only negative experience was my taxi driver from the airport could not find the entrance and front desk check-in location of the hotel.
The driver ended up dropping me off at the taxi stand in front of the Terminal 21 Shopping Mall.
From there, I had to carry my luggage and belongings to the hotel's entrance.

 · Had a very positive experience at this hotel. It is a true 5-star property.
From the facilities floor to the actual room, everything here feels very high end and there is a seemingly infinite amount of beautiful views of the city to be had.
Especially, the pool and tennis courts are incredibly beautiful around sunrise and sunset, with a stunning vista of the city around the property.
Everyone is quite helpful as well. As I was leaving, I wanted to take some pictures of a made up room and the staff kindly showed me to an unoccupied one so I could document it for sharing here and elsewhere. The lady that came with me, Bill, was very kind.
Will most certainly return on my next trip to Bangkok.Disliked
 · Had a bit of an issue at check in, but all was resolved after a few minutes.
Also with that, sports-wise, they were able to help me find a tennis hitter/coach while I was there.

The kitchenette and large fridge are good for longer stays, but for one night I did not use them.Disliked
 · More a question of style. The room was super modern, with lots of white, and sharp edges. I personally prefer a softer ambiente.

 · I’ve stayed their before and just love it. Easy access to Terminal 21 , the BTS and MRT. Great security and they always recognize you and acknowledge you with a smile. Most speak some English and eager to help. No worries when I’m there. I’ve been to Thailand 5 or 6 times and enjoy the location because I have easy and safe access to most of the sights from the BTS or MST which are much faster than travel by vehicles. The breakfast buffet and drinks in the lobby are very nice too. I was able to get the buffet on special for 1/2 off both times I’ve stayed there which brought it down to about $12.50. We don’t eat much so that price madecit worth it. At $25. Us , I had decided was too high. A lot of places use to include the breakfast. Theirs is great quality food , coffee, and juices. No one should be disappointed eating there due to the selections and service.Disliked
 · With so many choices of hotels, I paid more than some and way less than others. I had a better rate the first time I stayed. Over all I could not be happier with the facility and service. I plan to return if the rate is good. I’m retired so I have to think about money a little more so that I don’t run out before I die.",22,"Grande Centre Point Hotel Terminal21 - SHA Extra Plus

The house keeping cleaning standards should be increased, mirrors were not wiped on daily basis, floors were not clean enough.

I liked the breakfast selection that had a good combination of both Asian and Western food.Disliked
 · The breakfast area on the 5th floor was too crowded and the music that was played was too loud (it was some teenage pop music).

 · The AC fan system that pushes the air from the ducts into the room has a higher than expected noise level, surely ""within the limits"" but still annoying if you are trying to sleep ! The ""blackout blinds"" have no surrounds or ""pelmets"" so do not really do ""blackout"" and and light streams in early underneath and over the top of the blinds. As a family (2 adults and 2 kids) we discussed it and then decided spending THB 3,200 on breakfast was was not good value - but a s the location is so good there are many places to get a good breakfast close to the hotel at much lower costs.

 · They blocked the room amount and again when I reached the hotel the charged me again and took deposit. When I asked them when you will release the blocked amount they answer after 2 weeks. So, it did effect my budget when I was on vacation and I did face so difficulties to adjust with my remaining budget. 
Is it good way to attract tourist?",22,"Grande Centre Point Hotel Terminal21 - SHA Extra Plus

 · The room was very clean the view was very good. The breakfast was very good there was very much choice. And the hotel was very good location for shopping and site seeing. Didn't use the pool or gym so can't comment. The cleaning staff that cleaned the room was very nice .much nice than the guy that we saw at check in but saying that the lady at check out was pleasant enough.Disliked
 · The light in the kitchen area didn't switch off and kept us awake at night as it was bright .if a light needs to be on all night it should be dimmable. And could do with more hooks in the bathroom one hook for towels and dressing gowns. And the air conditioning was loud at night when trying to get to sleep with the light on .",22,"Grande Centre Point Hotel Terminal21 - SHA Extra Plus

 · Staffs from Concierge is very helpful, location is convenience. Breakfast is good with many choices.Disliked
 · We stayed at the hotel to celebrate my friend’s birthday. Before our arrival, email to the hotel to request a special set up for my friend's birthday on arrival. Hotel replied that they only can arrange a small birthday cake for complimentary or we pay for a bigger cake. For room decoration, it cost THB 3000 (picture shows the decoration with flowers leaves & two towel elephants only, not even ballrooms) or THB 3000 for red roses bouquets. I think this is too expensive for a simple décor. I asked if they can arrange the decoration instead of the cake, replied as “No”. Finally I decided to bring my stuff to Bangkok to DIY the room.
I remembered when I stayed in Galleria Sukhumvit 10 Bangkok hotel two years ago to celebrate my wedding anniversary. Hotel arranged room set up with decoration for free.
Upon checked in, receptionist confirmed the time to deliver the cake at 10 am. I waited from 09:50 till 10:30, no one came. Called to Front Desk, she told me that the cake shop is not opened yet, they will go to buy it later. I was shocked to hear that and never expected the hotel’s service is so poor. After I hanged up for just one minute, someone rang the door with a cake. It seems like they have no communication at all. A big surprise is that the cake is so tiny, I prefer to call it as a cup cake instead.
Another bad experience is when we were having breakfast in the restaurant, we were asked to pay for the breakfast twice even we told them it was included. Restaurant staff said she can't help and we must approach the check in counter to clarify. My friend was pissed off without finished her breakfast and went down to the lobby. As a result, we were told that they have made a mistake.
Our experience in Grande Centre Point Hotel Terminal 21 is bad, it is the worst hotel I've ever stayed in Thailand, is not value for the money. I felt so disappointed to choose it because of the location. I won’t recommend anyone to stay there.",22,"Grande Centre Point Hotel Terminal21 - SHA Extra Plus

 · 수영장이나 부대시설들도 다 괜찮았는데, 침대는 조금 아쉬웠어요. 꽤 단단한 편이라 그런 타입을 좋아하시면 좋겠지만 소프트한 면이 꽤 적습니다. 그것외에는 딱히 아쉬웠던 점은 없었어요!Show translation",22,"Grande Centre Point Hotel Terminal21 - SHA Extra Plus

 · At least from my room on the 4th floor, the view of Democracy Monument, a location with some historical importance, was a treat. The room, while a bit on the small side, looked and felt nice as well as clean. The hot water was hot and water pressure good. The bed was to my liking. That is to say the mattress felt firm and not too bouncy. The pool is an interesting setting, which I liked. The plant life and surroundings make it for a unique experience. Check-in and out was quick and easy. Staff were helpful and friendly. I had a good time exploring my surroundings by foot and the MRT station Sam Yot is about a 10 minute brisk walk from the hotel. The Wifi worked perfectly while I was there. I also have to say that the price I paid is very fair at app. 1500 baht for 2 nights.Disliked
 · The room itself looked nicer than the bathroom. Maybe a few aspects of the bathroom could be upgraded to match the bedroom better? I didn't mind it too much, but the swimming pool closing at 6 seems a little early. That said, considering how little direct sunlight the pool gets due to the surrounding buildings, the water is quite cold for someone who lives in Thailand. My personal preference would be not to have pop music playing at the swimming pool, but that's just me. A better way to get in and out of the hotel at night would be nice too. I can handle a big lock and chain but it feels weird to do so!",23,"Dinsomon Hotel

 · The location is good - about 15 mins walking each to Sam Yot metro station, China Town, and Khao san road. Amazing breakfast and really friendly staff! The room was clean with hairdryer, tea/coffee/drinking water and plenty of plug outlets.Disliked
 · We found that WiFi was poor throughout the hotel. Slow and sporadic, so planning anything online is almost impossible. 
The drains in the first room we had smelt awful. Reception kindly moved us to a different room but in this the shower head leaked as it wasn’t fitted properly. I wouldn’t normally mention this but when you’re showing multiple times a day because of the heat, it’s really inconvenient - especially for women - to be getting your hair wet every time! 
We also enquired about somewhere to get inexpensive drinks with a good nighttime view - they recommended Sky Bar (Lebua) where drinks are about 1,000 THB each, so we were a bit disappointed with that.",23,"Dinsomon Hotel

 · The room was a good size and clean. The bed was comfortable and had bedside lights. There was some storage and a safe. The AC worked well. The bathroom was very small but clean and there was hot water in the shower. There were some English channels on the TV. We stayed in two different rooms and one had a lovely view of the Democracy Monument and the other had a window that looked out on the dirty, decrepit wall of the building next door. The desk staff ladies were very friendly and helpful and spoke good English. The breakfast was quite good and offered some choices. We ate dinner there and the food was quite good. The pool area is nice and well maintained.Disliked
 · The breakfast box that we got when we left early for a tour was terrible and only contained an awful sandwich and we had prepaid $10 each for breakfast. The second day even though we had prepaid for breakfast we did not take the sandwich and had to get breakfast somewhere else.

 · A bit tricky to find since there are 2 more ""Dinso"" hotels in the immediate vicinity. Not everyone at the reception spoke English. If you pay by credit card, pay attention what they type into the terminal. They tried to charge me 14,000 USD (!) for a few nights stay, which I did not realize since the terminal was in Thai but thankfully my bank refused the transaction.

 · Location was good for our first visit to Bangkok. It is located right at the Democracy Monument which was a great landmark to give taxi drivers to find it easily (they do not always know the street names). We caught a local bus to the floating market (Taling Chan) about a two minute walk away from the hotel that was very convenient. You can easily walk to Kao San Road in under 10 minutes but none of that craziness spills over to the area where the hotel is. The lobby ""closes"" at 10:00 but there is always a security guard there if you need anything (though his English was very limited but he always smiled and tried to help a jet lagged traveler up at all hours of the night). The room was quieter then we expected at night since it is so near a main road (it is noisy during the day but night time was not an issue). The breakfast was a very nice buffet each morning. We had an 8am flight out of BKK and had no problem catching a cab on the main road at 5am (we did not prearrange transportation though the hotel will set that up for you if you would like- it does cost more though).Disliked

 · This was already our second stay in the hotel as we also stayed here during our last visit to Bangkok. Everything was great. The bed is super comfy and the room overall very nice, modern and had everything you needed. Staff is very friendly and helpful. Excellent breakfast including some Thai food options every morning. We also enjoyed swimming in the pool. Location is great with lots of shops and food options around. The location is very quiet so you'll get a great nights sleep.",23,"Dinsomon Hotel

 · This is a great little hotel with very nice English-speaking staff and large clean rooms. Building two is more modern and I personally prefer it to the older building one. Breakfast is very nice and accommodates Thai and Western tastes, but my absolute favorite is the automated coffee machine spewing out freshly ground delicious, invigorating, life-saving coffee.
There is an on-demand shuttle to Sukhumvit road, compensating the (walkable) distance from this main artery.Disliked

 · Some TV channels are of poor quality , if you need to go to the bathroom at night , you have to turn on all the lights to be able to switch on the bathroom light . I suppose that why there is a torch on the wall ; it feels a little surprising for a 4 stars hotel . It should be good if the breakfast waitress would tell that you can order cooked eggs as I only discover when leaving the dining room. It takes aroud 15 20 mns walk from the Nana BTS to the hotel .

 · The pool was nice. The food was good. Lots of nice people from all over the world. They had beers, when the beer ban was on...and lots of pretty girls to chat with. They hotel cut the room rates and breakfast rates while I was there, which made it more affordable for people.Disliked
 · The hotel was very nice. The staff wonderful and friendly. The cafe and breakfast service, massage services, etc. Were very nice and relaxing and affordable. My only complaint was the very loud people in other rooms. I could hear just about everything going on in the rooms above and beside me. One night the people above me were running a marathon all night on the floor. Until like 5-6:00am stomp, stomp, stomp...back and forth, back and forth...kept me awake all night...I finally got to sleep about 6:30 am and i awoke to the phone ringing from the front desk at 12:00...The next night was the same, but I just put in my headphones and turned on some sleep music. I checked out that morning and went elsewhere. It had a lot to do with the COVID-19 lockdown I think. Lots of people just stuck at a hotel with a 10:00 curfew. I suppose just have to take the good with the bad. But it was quite annoying.",24,"Alt Hotel Nana by UHG

 · I may have booked this at a discounted rate, I do not quite remember. But the price I paid was was roughly the same as any other room I've paid for in the area (Which is I think 5 or 6 now) and this was by far the nicest, freshest and most stylish, also probably the most comfortable as well as being very clean. I will definitely be staying here again next time I pass through BKK. 
Also the staff were friendly (some dressed in costume for Halloween and gave me candy like a trick or treater when I checked out!) and a free ride to the main road and BTS Station was offered. Which is a nice touch as it's not too far but it's a good walk, and far enough from the craziness and bars that the hotel feels secludedDisliked
 · The pool is very small and seemed crowded with half a dozen people. But this is no complaint. There was still a pool, and there was a small gym there also.

The bed was comfortable and the shower was amazing. We even had a little private outdoor seating area. The location is perfect - just a 10 minute walk from a busy area of Bangkok and it is really close to a SKYTRAIN station which are really simple to navigate and the best way of getting around. And of course, having the rooftop chill area and the pool too was such a blessing after being in the hustle and bustle of Bangkok.

thank the whole staff including the very helpful receptionist who is the only one I could see always smiling despite her mask on. There is a free shuttle that brings you until the main road and stops you wherever you want on the way and back. Drivers are helpful and always available. The breakfast is delicious with healthy and different styles of food (buffet).
Rooms are nicely cleaned every day. They are silent and comfortable. Laundry comes back done the same day if you give it early enough. I highly recommend this place whether it is for short or long term. I will certainly come again here when I will be back in Bangkok.
Many many thanks for all.

The next morning, I attempted to check again with different shift of staff, I was able to get extend to 1pm. 
The 2nd attempt, as a result of wasting my time to beg for another hour for checking out due to 1st attempt was failed.
With that, I was not happy.
Thanks.",25,"De Prime@Rangnam

 · The hotel is new, everything is clean and well working. The lobby and Cafe downstairs are cost. The staff are helpful and friendly. The hotel is just a short walk away from the Bts station and King Power duty free shop. There is also a shopping center near the Bts and the victory monument is also in walking distance.Disliked
 · The rooms facing the school has an early wakeup when the traffic directing man starts whistling by the street and the school bell rings. Also, the Kodi system used with the TV is ok in itself but has no movie channels and many of the English speaking news channels, like BBC, weren't working.",25,"De Prime@Rangnam

 · -location is very good!!! Its very close and good connected to the airport Suvarabhumi. The easiest and cheapest way to get to the airport is to take the Airport Raillink to Ratchaprarop (approx 20 minutes) and then walk to the hotel for approx. 10 minutes.
The location is also good for sightseeing. You don't always need to grab a taxi. The next skytrain station is Victory Monument (less than 10 minutes walk). 
A lot of food markets can be reached by a short walk from the hotel. One is at the end of the same street next to the station Victory Monument. And I recommend the Neon nightmarket with plenty of food stalls (approx 20 minutes walk). Lots of restaurants and a 7 eleven are also on the same street as the hotel.
- the hotel is modern and quite new. The room was spacious and comfortable. Very modern bathroom and large shower.
-staff is great!! Concierge and reception were very friendly and helpful.Disliked
 · -The air conditioning was very loud.
- Not everytime, but sometimes there was really a bad smell in the bathroom. I read that before in other reviews, but it was actually not as bad as expected.
-no European breakfast. That would have been nice. But at least a live cooking egg station",25,"De Prime@Rangnam

 · The pool area is fantastic and on the first day we had a great breakfast. The room was comfortable and spacious and the hotel is elegantly decorated. Excellent location well connected with airportDisliked
 · Some of the staff at front desk and in the restaurant did not speak English well enough to answer very basic questions. In a 4 star hotel I would expect at least front desk staff to speak good English. The porter was very helpful and promptly stepped in to assist his colleague. On the first day breakfast was very good, it was Chinese dishes for the hot side, but on the second day they tried to do some Italian dishes and they were not good, or they had nothing to do with Italian cuisine. I think it would be better if they just sticked to Asian cuisine which they are very good at, leaving aside poor imitations of western cuisine.",25,"De Prime@Rangnam

 · Our stay in this place belonged to a very nice, extremely friendly staff, great atmosphere we are going back there in 2 weeks. Very good location near Mrt and the center. Rooftop pool small, but enough to relax. Shops and restaurants as well as 2 pharmacies by the hotel. Delicious breakfasts deserve a separate topic. Every day there is a different theme and the kitchen then includes dishes from the country. Nice idea because you can get to know other cuisines and flavors. Here everyone is trying to make your time unique and niceDisliked
 · The only minus was the lack of hot water in the bathroom, in a hotel with such a standard and price it is unacceptable!
basically it is not a big disadvantage but maybe the inconvenience the beds were small. Narrow and short, if you are tall pay attention to it because I have 185cm in height and barely fit",25,"De Prime@Rangnam

 · We reached hotel about night 9pm and was welcome by the friendly staff n a welcome drink of own choice and it came with a welcome card and fruit basket. That’s really thoughtful of the hotel. Staff English was ok so communication no issue at all. We booked for family suite room. Both rooms are bigger than norm hotel with extra hall area for relaxation. Breakfast was better than expected. As a small hotel we thought the menu will be the same daily but the hotel came out with differ theme each day . American, CHinese , Italian, Jap n Thai . So there’s always some new food to look forward daily . The surrounding is very quiet at night m with a lot of cheap n nice food around. It’s only a 5 min walk to the BTS Virtory Monument station . The last day we went to the shopping center around the BTS skywalk to shop. There’s a small shopping mall called Center One n Soi Roy Ran. The clothes there are relatively cheap n nice with lesser crowd. There’s also a famous Thai boat noodle place there that worth trying . The noodles each small bowl only cost 15 baht . It’s a must to try if happen to be around .Disliked
 · The only thing that I don’t like is the master bedroom toilet shower water flow was quite slow and in the morning it’s abit noisy since there’s a sch beside the hotel . But it’s perfectly already as it can serve as alarm clock for us to wake up.",25,"De Prime@Rangnam

 · Housekeeping staffs are polite - perhaps more so than front desk officers.
Bed is comfortable.Disliked
 · 1. A/C unit is placed on the ledge right outside hotel room - could hear the unit working from the inside.
2. Air flow is inconsistent - bursts of cold air followed by periods of hotness.
3. Room is not well noise-isolated at all - could even hear people talking above a certain volume.
4. But the worst part is the smell - the toilet stinks of urine. Alerted housekeeping and front desk regarding this. Housekeeping sprayed something (?) and aired the room for two hours while we went out, but the smell only worsen by the time we returned. The saving grace was that we managed to change the room which didn't smell as bad. Phew.",25,"De Prime@Rangnam

 · The reception staff was amazing and the fact that there was a small pool on the roof was nice. The lobby area is pretty OK as well.Disliked
 · The hotel looks nice enough from outside but once inside, the atmosphere changes. The hallways aren't air conditioned so for us, living on the top floor, this was unpleasant as it was super hot. The reception staff was great whereas the waiters in the restaurant need to learn English. It was impossible to get anything right. Simple words l8ke cheese and butter (by the way there was no cheese or butter) as well as salt and pepper took ages to explain. The breakfast was bad, geared only to Chinese travellers. The coffee was horrible. No coffee machine, just a very badly brewed coffee. No hot milk. Honestly, this place seriously needs to work on the breakfast offering and finding competent staff. Another thing was actually room air conditioning which was really sub par. Only the area right in front of the outlet got cooled properly and the bathroom remained hot. It was an OK stay for two nights but would not want to do it again.",25,"De Prime@Rangnam

 · This time round I can only praise the pool and the dimensions and decor of the room which were niceDisliked
 · Unfortunately my second stay at this hotel was not at all satisfactory. The bathroom had a terrible smell which made it absolutely unbearable to use. When I went to wash in the morning I had to hold my breath and take pauses in and out. When I complained to front desk asking to check the ventilation or at least spray the bathroom, they said they would ask housekeeping but no action was taken. The room was extremely noisy, we were woken at 6.30 am to the sound of traffic and loud whistle from the street, the windows are not soundproof and furthermore the balcony window was not shut properly and was blocked, so we couldn't do anything to shut it. They asked for a 100 usd cash deposit which is a ridiculous amount of money I have never been asked so much in a 4 or 5 star hotel, it's more than I paid the room. Either 2000 baht o 100 usd, they would not accept credit card. Breakfast was ""American"" style and some of the items were not good, it is much better when they just stick to what they do well, Chinese and thai food.",25,"De Prime@Rangnam

 · The hotel is located in the new part of Bangkok, about 800m from the airport trainservice and at walking distance from the victory monument and the Jim Thompson's house (about 1 km). The room was very spacious, clean and nicely decorated. There were also more supplies than I expected.
 Airco & wifi worked well. Upon arrival we received a voucher for a welcome's drink in the bar of the hotel and also a restaurant was available in the hotel. As we had to leave early in the morning for our connection, we didn't have the opportunity to enjoy the breakfast, but we received a breakfast on the go instead. Check in went very smoothly, but the check out took a bit more time than foreseen (before checking us out, they wanted to check on the room, which seemed strange to us). The staff was very friendly and service oriented.Disliked

 · The area around is very nice, a lot of restaurants-with thai prices, very nice shops. The intrance and looby looks nice with the high ceiling.Disliked
 · When I arrived via taxi with a lot of luggage, no one came to help me initially, I had to ask them to get my luggage which was standing in front of the door. Staff were chatting at the reception, not attentive nor friendly. 
Room was dirty, several hairs on the floors, dirty bedsheets. After I went to the reception to tell very appropriote and friendly the about the dirty (and therefore health consern) , they send someone to clean it. I was very unhappy with the solution, since I had an long journey behind me and only wanted to sleep and not wait longer-what I told. I Asked them for another room or eventually an upgrade. They told me they already upgraded me-what was not true because the mentions the wrong name and I was exactly in the room section as booked and as pictured on booking.com.
When I came back in my room, they have changed the bed sheet but the linen was still dirty same as the pillow (black mold spots) . So I checked out the same day, as I was too tired to complain again about the same problem, because they didn't fix it and weren't motivated to do a great guest experience. Staff didn't even ask about why I was leaving the same day, only telling 'ah are you doing an early check out' . 
I had to pay the room for that night. After sending a complain email to the supervisors, they excused themselfes and oftered me a upgrade for my next stay, but I won't consider to stay there again. 
Rooms are quite small, simple, its very hot, humid inside and the lighing is bad.",25,"De Prime@Rangnam

 · We had booked a 2-BR suite and the adjoining double room. The breakfast was quite okay and so was the location of the hotel.Disliked
 · The staff training and behavior could do with improvement. We reached early and the reception staff asked us to wait till 2 pm. However, at 2 pm, the reception staff said the rooms were not still available as the former guests had not vacated, even though the check-out time was at noon - they were demonstrating flexibility at our expense! When we started protesting, the rooms were allotted almost immediately - not sure what was going on. A few days later, during check-out, suddenly all the flexibility disappeared and strictly only 1 hour extension was given. The staff was curt and the supervisor/ officer at the reception (in a black jacket) was positively rude.
There were no closet/ shelves in the suite to unpack - even the safe was on the floor (see picture)! The suite had a work table but no chair and it took 2 days for the staff to get us one - thank goodness for small mercies!",25,"De Prime@Rangnam

 · The staff (as a whole, and individually) are very attentive and professional. The front desk personnel were helpful and efficient. My housekeeping person always went above and beyond to cheerfully and professionally reset the room to brand-new condition. The only thing better than the food at the attached restaurant (Monsoon) was the level of friendly and cheerful service by their staff. The location is beyond convenient, with the Nana BTS (sky train) station a mere 3 minute walk from the hotel, and almost immediate access to taxis either in front of the hotel itself or along Sukhumvit Road 2 minutes away, All in all, an excellent choice for a hotel in Bangkok.Disliked
 · The ONLY item that I wish were different would be the shower, and more specifically, the shower door. (I should probably mention that I am a bit larger than the average western traveler at 6 foot 3 inches and 275 pounds). In order to enter and use the shower, I had to ""hug"" the wall with the shower door against my stomach and ""roll"" with it to close it. This was a MINOR inconvenience, but a small challenge nonetheless. Had I been a bit more portly, I do not know how I could have closed it. If you are a larger individual such as I, you might find it useful to ask if there is a slightly larger shower in the room you will be assigned to.",26,"Adelphi Suites Bangkok - SHA Extra Plus

 · Housekeeping ignoring the DND sign and removing the doona which was not replaced. But no big deal. Just a room number error I think. Your staff checked on the computer.",26,"Adelphi Suites Bangkok - SHA Extra Plus

 · Very spacious with a super comfortable bed. I really like Soi8 and it's my go-to place whenever I go to Bangkok .... especially if I have any business at The Trendy building - visa etc.
I have stayed at different hotels, but this hotel part of this establishment is one of the better ones.Disliked
 · I normally frequent Aviva restaurant a few metres away which serves the same menu - excellent food, if a little expensive.. Even though it's the same food 'with the same prices', the restaurant attached to this hotel finds it appropriate to levy a 10% service charge and 7% vat on top of the menu price (+ service charge) ..... it is in very very small print.
Actually, the restaurant service wasn't brilliant anyway.
So, it is an expensive alternative to identical establishments on the same Soi.8",26,"Adelphi Suites Bangkok - SHA Extra Plus

 · My room was clean with all the essential equipment. The staff are very friendly and helpful. They helped me arrange the Test & Go package and the arrangement went smoothly. When I left the hotel, I lost my phone on the road to my next destination. After I realised I lost it, I went back to check if I could find it on the road but the attempt was futile. Then I asked the Adelphi Suites staff for help. They let me go back to my room to see if it was there but the result was again frustrating. Afterwards, the staff member on the reception helped me to call my number to see if anyone picked up my phone on the road. A very kind Egyptian picked up the phone and told us how he could return it to me. I really appreciate what the Adelphi Suites staff had done for me!!",26,"Adelphi Suites Bangkok - SHA Extra Plus

 · A short walk to Nana BTS, 10 minute walk to Terminal 21 (Asok BTS is there). The location is central and provides easy access to the rest of Bangkok. If you like walking you can reach Lumphini Park in about 30 minutes or so. Walk west on Sukhumvitt for 10+ minutes to reach great street food under the freeway. 
The room was clean, comfortable and has a decent kitchen area for light cooking. The view from my east facing room was fantastic. The rooms are basically small apartments with hotel amenities as an extra. 
The pool is small but adequate for a few laps or a refreshing soak. The fitness room has a good range of weight machines and treadmills/bikes. 
The desk staff was friendly and helpful. Housekeeping staff is also friendly, professional and efficient. 
I extended my two week stay and probably would have stayed longer if my room had been available. Sound Pop coffee right next to 7-11 is highly recommended.Disliked

 · The location was good as just as you walk out of the hotel ,to your left and right you have bars and restaurants.At the intersection once you cross the road you see many India restaurants that serve amazing food.Near the hotel you have street vendors in the evening selling that food and fresh fruits there is also a 7/11 very close to the hotel and many massage parlours .I booked the Black Friday deal so was a very reasonable deal for 3 nights and if you bid on booking.com you get an upgrade if approved.So the upgraded room was very spacious with a microwave washing machine in the living room area and a television,the bedroom had a television too .However the coffee shop is being renovated and I was told it will open in January.No bar in hotel and can’t drink by the pool on the 16 th floor.Al, rooms are non smoking but you can smoke on the 16 th floor.Khun Bell at reception is very helpful and if you need a taxi 🚖 she can arrange that for you.Had a wonderful stay ,and will visit again soon .Disliked

 · Stayed several time at Adelphi Suites. 
The hotel location is excellent, 2 min walk from Nana BTS station.
15 mins ride to Phaya Thai BTS station to get the train to airport.
10 min to Asoke BTS station (Terminal 21 mall) and Sukhumvit MRT station (from there to ride to Chatuchak week-end market). 5 min bts ride to Siam BTS Center (Siam Paragon mall), add a couple of mins more to National Stadium BTS station (where MBK mall is).
Well maintained hotel with a pool and well equipped fitness centre.
Stayed in a Studio room that is very large room with a small living room, a small kitchen with hot plate heater, microwave, large fridge, plates, cutlery.
Staff are friendly.Disliked

 · Was traveling through Bangkok several times in Nov/Dec 2019 and needed a room for 1 or 2 nights on 3 separate occasions. The hotel I normally stay at inexplicably decided to double their usual rates so I thought I’d try a new place. The ratings for Adelphi Suites were very high and I decided to give it a chance. I received a complimentary upgrade on the first visit, which was very nice and really enjoyed the bigger room. On the next 2 stays I received the room I booked which was also quite large with a small kitchen and separate sitting area. Overall I really like this hotel as the rooms are large, beds are comfortable, everything is well maintained and the staff is quite nice.Disliked
 · My only complaint was with the in room WiFi which was frankly terrible. Constantly getting the dreaded “No Internet Connection” message on my phone and laptop even though the devices were connected to the WiFi. Called the front desk the first few times and they suggested the usual reboot the router, which would work for a few minutes before going back to the no Internet message. In the end I used my phone as a hotspot to get some work done on the laptop. Still, all in all, I will consider staying here again as everything else was quite nice.",26,"Adelphi Suites Bangkok - SHA Extra Plus

Restaurants and bars which opens till 2am (but not noisy) are just around the corner. Many spa/massage place to choose from, for a little pampering.

 · The staff were all very friendly and helpful. Hotel was very clean and secure. We upgraded to a suite for an additional $16 a night and were very pleased with the suite so I cannot speak to a standard room. The hotel is located around 200 feet from the BTS Skytrain Nana Station so it is super convenient. The outdoor pool was nice, up on the 16th floor and there was a fairly decent fitness center adjacent that also had great views. Breakfasts were good with quite a variety of foods and a very attentive staff. It was very quiet at night with well soundproofed rooms. We stayed on the 15th floor.Disliked
 · A very minor thing but some sanitizer spray bottles in the fitness center to wipe down the equipment would be nice. Also maybe reduce the minibar prices so it is more like a service instead of a high profit add on. It would greatly increase sale of the items.",26,"Adelphi Suites Bangkok - SHA Extra Plus

Unlimited breakfast in the morning, the choice was reasonable. Fresh, made-to-order, omelettes available and some continental options.

Although small, it was nice knowing there was some balcony space.Disliked

 · - Check in process smooth and welcoming with good lobby
- Staff are very friendly, well trained and resolved a miscommunication error very swiftly, in particularly Krishna, who was outstanding with communication
- Spacious room and comfortable
- Shuttle service is provided to the nearest Sky Train stations
- Welcome fruits and fresh water was provided when requestedDisliked
 · - Location is a challenge as due to traffic on the Main Street leading to the hotel which is expected as traffic is predominant in Bangkok
- Breakfast was awful, very limited intercontinental breakfast and rest was Asian but even so, the quality and taste was poor. It is Thailand, could at least serve wider variety of fresh fruits
- Hallways lacked air condition so it was too warm outside the room
- Bath tub/shower needs to be replaced as it is too high and definitely a hazard",27,"Le D'Tel Bangkok

 · I loved the hotel and everyone that works there. However, I think breakfast wasn't really worth the money I paid for it. The quality of the food could be way better. French toast isn't made with white bread as it was served, the coffee was instant (they could have a coffee machine), there was no scrambled eggs and instead they offered fried eggs that sat there for hours, the sausages served for breakfast are cheap and super unhealthy, and I honestly expected some bacon too. I'm sorry if I sound rude but it's not my intention at all. As I said before, I loved staying there and I'll probably come back as I live in Samui and come to Bangkok very often. It's my honest opinion and I hope you understand that your breakfast could be a lot better if you make little changes. If you compare the quality of breakfast offered at the bakeries around the hotel you'll see what I mean. We went to a bakery nearby where we spent half of what we spent at Le D'Tel and the food and coffee were way better.
Thanks for the great hospitality, Le D'Tel.
Hope to see you all soon.

The front desk gave me directions but I couldn’t quite figure out where to go - so instead of drawing me a map and sending me on my way one of the employees accompanied me the three blocks to make sure I could find it.
The night before we stayed at a hotel about four block away from this one. Spending $25 dollars less, and had a terrible experience.

 · El hotel está fenomenal. Es limpio, está bien situado y en la zona tienes muchos servicios, desde el mercado nocturno hasta masajes y restaurantes que están bien de precio. 
Sin duda lo que se lleva el oro es la piscina y las vistas que tiene. Si bien la piscina no es enorme, no se necesita mucho más para refrescarte después de un día de turismo y contemplar el atardecer. Merece la pena.Disliked
 · El checking fue bastante largo porque no encontraban la reserva (finalmente sí) y aunque había puesto en mi petición una cama grande, el tipo insistió en que si quería mejor dos camas separadas. Entiendo que es una cultura diferente, pero si el cliente marca la opción y después de una pregunta confirmo mi petición, no es necesario remarcar la cuestión.Show translation",27,"Le D'Tel Bangkok

 · Bardzo fajna lokalizacja - zaraz po wyjściu z hotelu jesteśmy na typowej miejskiej ulicy, gdzie toczy się życie a wieczorami nieopodal ożywa miejski streetfood. Blisko do BTS i Metra jednak odległość raczej nie na spacer - trzeba skorzystać z taxi, graba albo z oferowanej przez hotel darmowej podwózki np. do BTS (hotel ma określone godziny w jakich odjeżdża bus). Fajny basen na górze, nieoblegany i niezatłoczony - mam porównanie z innym świetnym hotelem w Bangkoku - tutaj jest cisza i relaks. Poza wielkim łóżkiem mieliśmy fajną sofę w pokoju (czyli oddzielona strefa do spania i do oglądania np. TV)Disliked

 · Удивительно, но откуда у этого отеля 5 звёзд???
Забронирован был номер ,,Премьер’’... тк мы после долгого пути и заселение у нас происходило почти в 22 часа акцентировать на то что нам выдали не стали . Но на следующий день увы после уборки нам вообще не доложили туалетную бумагу. Потом мы рассмотрели постельное белье ... и уму не постижимо... как так... в пододеяльнике куча дыр... и это 5 звёзд ... Вечером решили посидеть у бассейна на крыше и там же зона где можно курить , в итоге ровно в 21 час нас попросили оттуда уйти ...( И Ладе если у вас есть балкон , то там курить запрещено! 
В номере полумрак. Свет не регулируется. Кондиционер дует со всей дури на кровать, а если делаешь его тихо то он шумит как самолёт перед взлётом... 
А ещё удивили двери ... шумоизоляции там вообще нет ни какой , но слава богу было тихо... но даже если закрыта дверь, то свет из коридора проходит в номер из всех щелей , как будто она открыта (((

 · Die Lage des Hotel, der Pool und das Frühstück waren gut. 
Die Mitarbeiter waren sehr freundlich und bemüht.Disliked
 · Leider war es kein 5 Sterne Hotel Standard. Das Hotel hat zwar einen sehr guten Internetauftritt aber hinter den Kulissen kann dies nicht umgesetzt werden. 
Personal: 
Das Personal war sehr freundlich. Jedoch konnten die meisten kaum Englisch sodass die Verständigung sehr schwierig war. Eine Getränkebestellung vom Pool aus war nur per Telefon möglich und dauerte eine gefühlte Ewigkeit. 
Zimmer:
Die Zimmer waren trotz Deluxe Ausstattung eher klein. Das Badezimmer ging garnicht. Die Dusche/Badewanne war so konstruiert, dass man nach jeder Dusche automatisch das Komplette Badezimmer Unterwasser gesetzt hat.
Da das Wasser nur sehr schlecht ablief musste man Handtücher und Bademäntel zum trocknen auslegen. Leider entstand über Nacht ein sehr fauler Geruch im Zimmer. Absolute Fehlkonstruktion!
Service:
Die Zimmer wurden jeden Tag neu gereinigt. Jedoch war unser Zimmer erst gegen 17:30 fertig. Hier würde ich mir wünschen mehr Personal einzustellen.
Man kann nicht vom Kunden verlangen bis zum späten Nachmittag zu warten um ein frisches Bett und Handtücher zu bekommen.
Leider wurde uns auch unberechtigter Weise Wasser aus der Minibar berechnet, die wir nicht getrunken haben. Es handelt sich um nur 1€ pro Flasche jedoch geht es hier nicht um den Geldbetrag sondern um den Versuch.Show translation",27,"Le D'Tel Bangkok

 · Rooms are small and a bit warn out, no electricity plug next to the bed, so, it makes stay really uncomfortable. 
First day they did not serve breakfast as a buffet motivating it covid government rules, but the same evening they did serve dinner buffet. I spoke with receptionist about it and happily next morning we got very good breakfast buffet.",29,"Ibis Bangkok Riverside - SHA Extra Plus

It was hard to get anyone's attention as they were busy serving others. After 15 minutes, we got up and left. On another occasion, while relaxing by the pool, no one came by to ask if we wanted to order anything as we would have liked to order some drinks, but no waiter/waitress was attentive to the people laying by the pool.

Unfortunately your hotel did not provide information on the river taxis to get to the other side.Disliked
 · The buffet breakfast was good but could be improved with one or two more Thai foods. The steamed sausages were not a plus. The sunny side up eggs appeared a bit raw. Having some omelette would be a good. It is interesting that Thai mangoes were not provided at all. Better to have mangoes instead of honeydew fruit. The lobster, prawn & crab buffet dinner could be better if regular large prawns were used instead of Tiger prawns. The grilled fish offering had used 'Dory' or 'Bassa' fish which were pretty textureless and bland.",29,"Ibis Bangkok Riverside - SHA Extra Plus

Decent breakfast, especially for the pretty low price. Good coffee and pastries, and some nice cooked options.
Very nice staff, always happy to help.Disliked
 · The bathroom is comically tiny! It didn't bother us for a 2 night stay, but maybe any more and it might get annoying.
The two beds in our twin room were SUPER close together and there was no way to separate them really. This could be awkward if you're not a family like us.",29,"Ibis Bangkok Riverside - SHA Extra Plus

 · The location is wonderful, with nice river view especially from the garden, and BTS (Skytrain) nearby. The staff are very friendly and helpful. About the coffee: the coffee in the room is your run of the mill Nescafé, but the espresso from the restaurant is good (you have to pay ofc.).Disliked

 · We really enjoyed the breakfast, the location, and the view. The hotel provided a great variety of breakfast each day. There were many selections that was really good to wake up too. Also the location was really convenient to many great places especially the mall ICONSIAM (a definite must see)! As for the view it was close to the river, which is always a great experience to see in the morning!
Last but not least, the staff is very helpful and are always there to support and care for their guests.Disliked
 · The only thing that I didn't like was the flooring, the sink, and the shower. The floor was quite old and there were times that the wood floor was peeling or shifted when we walked on it. As for the sink it was scratched up with dark marks on it and it looked like it had been through a lot. The shower was a bit tight and when you turned on the water it would seep through the doors causing the floors to get wet. 
OH AND THERE IS ONLY ONE PUMP THAT IS A 3 IN 1 THAT IS FILLED WITH SHAMPOO, CONDITIONER, AND BODY GEL ALTOGETHER. If you need more products for your hygiene I would suggest to bring your own or purchase some at the convenient stores.
If the hotel just did some remodeling to the rooms that have damages it would be fine.",29,"Ibis Bangkok Riverside - SHA Extra Plus

 · This is my 3rd time here in IBIS riverside. I particularly like it because it is away from the hustle and bustle of the city. It is by the riverside which is a much calmer, relaxed vibe. The hotel is very family friendly, and the staffs are really helpful. The restaurant offers different type of ala carte menu, or you can choose to have the buffet as well. The pricing of the food is quite reasonable as well, and you can order room service as well. The breakfast is amazing, with wide variety of food from asian to continental. We enjoyed the breakfast to the fullest, everyday it was a different breakfast. 
The rooms are decent size, and very clean, we got a room for ourself with the river view which was amazing. I would highly recommend this hotel for families, and groups, as transportation can be figured out quite easily at the hotel desk.Disliked

 · 1. Breakfast range is ok, it was as generous as other 5-star hotels I've stayed at. 
2. I had enquired in advance if I could have adjoining rooms with one room preferably disabled friendly and was happy that the hotel replied that they will try their best without promising but yet on arrival it was noted and arranged for already
3. Tull, the supervisor at the restaurant/bar at the riverside terrace was exceptionally helpful with sightseeing tips and following day when I took our elderly mum on wheelchair, he immediately rushed to guide and assisted her to a table with a good view of the riverside. Thank you so much for the sincere hospitality as it was very difficult for us to convince our mum to join us for overseas holiday trips and the fear of burdening others with her lack of movement. She was just happy with ice-cream and your care wheeling her in and out of the restaurant!
4. We spoke to 2 different staffs at the Tours & Sightseeing counter, Tomi & Ai/Oi - they are right candidates (although they dont belong to the hotel) at the desk for enquiries and sight-seeing arrangements. Very friendly, honest and we felt assured that our sight-seeing trip is safe.Disliked
 · 1. There was a section of the breakfast dining area which leaked and I nearly trip with my sandals. The floor tiling with water on surface is not very safe - should look into this section.
2. I could sense that there are double standards when Front Office staffs attended to guests who are Caucasians versus Asians like our group. I did a courtesy reminder to inform the FO staff during registration that since one of our rooms is 3-bedded/triple share, to kindly ensure we have at least an extra bath towel and bottled water in the room. The staff looked like she was surprised I mentioned this and replied with a sacarstic tone to ""Of Course"".
- True enough, even after I had called housekeeping from the room phone - the towels and extra bottled water never came any day even after we checked out.
- Nevermind! We walked to 7-Eleven quickly so that we don't have to wait for the kettle to boil.",29,"Ibis Bangkok Riverside - SHA Extra Plus

 · I had an absolutely brilliant stay at this Hotel for about 2 weeks. The staff are really welcoming and friendly. The room is nicely furnished, shower is fantastic, bed is comfy AND it was nice and quiet at night during my stay.
Breakfast is literally a highlight, loads of options from Noodle/curry to freshly made Omelette [highly recommend] or traditional English breakfast foods, fruit juices, you name it.
The pool is a good size for a gentle dip and is an ideal size to relax around a few hours a day. The gym is good by hotel standards. Location wise you are close to the up market Malls of Centreworld, Gaysorn and Siam Paragon. All 3 offer something different. The BTS Chit lom station is about 10 to 15 minutes walk from the hotel, not onerous. Taxis have no issue finding the hotel. And Lumpini Park is about 15 minutes the other direction away from the main Road.",30,"Courtyard by Marriott Bangkok - SHA Extra Plus

 · Room was well appointed and had everything I needed to keep comfortable. I spent a total of 18 nights at the hotel this trip. I was travelling within Thailand midway through my trip, but, before I left, I had requested that I stay in the same room on the back half of my stay. 
Location is excellent. The BTS station for the two BTS lines are so close. Shopping at places like Central World or Paragon are easily within walking distance. Both of those large malls have great food court/restaurants where food can be found that fits all budgets. And the food quality is so high even for the inexpensive meals. For those that want to be more courageous, there are many food choices within 1 km where you find small open air restaurants as well as the food vendors on the street. For those Westerners that want more home fast food...that's also available in and around the hotel. The area is so nice that if I were to purchase a condo in the area, I would seriously consider this area where the hotel is located.Disliked
 · Since my travel was during the pandemic (just at the time when the Omnicron variant was exploding around the world, but, not in Thailand), I wanted to keep exercising in a gym. The hotel gym is a decent size but only 1 of 4 treadmills actually worked. A bit disspointing as two of the treadmills were marked 'closed' for social distancing but were also marked as in operative because they were just broken.",30,"Courtyard by Marriott Bangkok - SHA Extra Plus

Th service was good, and I asked can I live higher floor (2F out of 15), their answer was quite blunt saying, only half rooms available due to renovations, and my budget only deserves this floor, any floor high up is next level of budget. I mean ok I get the pricing, but the renovation is on your hotel, which is your problem first place not having option for me to live higher up.

 · When I booked hotel, 1 of reason I chose is the hotel provides tuk tuk for guest to station nearby, but when we need to use tuk tuk, we were informed that it is fully booked for 6 guests and if we want to use, we have to wait for another 20mins. I think the hotel should have 1 more tuk tuk for guests as it is not that close to walk to station. We are not lazy to walk but sometimes we need tuk tuk for short distance when we carry heavy thing as taxi will not available for short distance. 
This is not really a dislike, but it troubled us when we arrived. The first room we checked in fully smells of smoke. The cleaning staff said that the previous guest smoked in the room even it is non-smoking room. Bad guests. Hotel asked us to wait and they will spray the room, but as the smell is too strong, we asked for new room and we got new one with no smell of smoke. Hotel should have charged previous guest $1000 for smoking in room :)) coz such guests destroyed a non-smoking room :((",30,"Courtyard by Marriott Bangkok - SHA Extra Plus

 · Staff could have respond better. Shuttle Tuk Tuk is supposed to facilitate residents to and from city centre. Made a request for a Tuk Tuk to pick me up from Amarin Centre an hour later. Instead of giving me a good answer or apology, the lady concierge only said you were not allowed to do so as it was on a first-come-first-serve arrangement. She just asked me to call at the time when I needed the tuk tuk instead of giving me any further advice.
A bit strange, that was my request with sufficient notice. Even if this was not feasible, she could have replied by saying that would try to but could not guarantee the time as other residents may have other requests etc. Or if you only have one tuk tuk or one driver, please state on your notice clearly that you would try to facilitate but not committed etc.
A bit disappointed for the response and arrangement and I simply walked to and from the shopping mall and hotel at the end.",30,"Courtyard by Marriott Bangkok - SHA Extra Plus

 · The smell of our room is not good, smells like old and the toilet need refurbishing too. In their phones it is indicated that international and toll free calls are charged as 100 baht. I called the airline company overseas because I had issues with our airplane seats. I waited for too long for the customer service to answer but no one picked up. Before checking out, I was told that I was charged 3000 baht due to the call I made. I told them that I was not able to talk to the one I called and they decided to charge me 50% of the amount. The phone note for call charges inside the hotel room is very misleading and is not true. We are also asked for a deposit amount before checking in the hotel.
We also tried their buffet breakfast and it was bland. The chicken sausage is too salty, not hot anymore and the breads are not that soft. The orange juice is not pure.

Pienen väännön jälkeen hotelli jousti brekkarissa ja antoi juomakuponkeja puuttuvan loungen tilalle. En tiedä onko syy hotellissa vai varauspalvelussa, mutta usein kyllä varaussivustoilla luvataan enemmän kuin varauksen edetessä saa.

The breakfast could use some work. It’s composed of a choice of a set and a buffet with fruits, vegetables, bread, rice and a couple of hot dishes. The sets are the same each day and unfortunately all processed meat. Not good.

 · Het ontvangst was zeer vriendelijk. Het personeel spreekt goed Engels. De kamer is heel erg ruim. Wij boekten deze accommodatie als laatste nacht voor onze terugvlucht, dus het was veel meer dan we nodig hadden. Het was geen enkel probleem om na het uitchecken nog de hele middag bij het zwembad te verblijven tot ons vertrek. Er is zelfs gelegenheid om nog te douchen. Voor wie Bangkok wil ontdekken: de metro rijdt op loopafstand van de accommodatie en brengt je overal!Disliked
 · De badkamer is enigszins gedateerd. Douchen in bad met een douchegordijn. De bedjes bij het zwembad zijn oncomfortabel en duidelijk aan vervanging toe.Show translation",31,"Abloom Exclusive Serviced Apartments

 · 地理位置不错，离samna pao地铁站很近～ 房间够宽敞，可以自己烹煮一些简单的食物～
711便利店隔壁的按摩店不错，性价比很好，按摩师很认真，晚上回来可以按摩一下再回酒店（要记得提前预约），很舒服～Disliked
 · 屋内有股不太好闻的味道，空调通风也去除不掉～ 卫生间的淋雨设施有些老旧，洗澡的时候水流会流到浴缸外的地板上，行走要小心～
另外就是床垫也有些旧了，已经被躺出凹陷，睡觉感受不是很舒服，需要更换新的床垫了～Show translation",31,"Abloom Exclusive Serviced Apartments

 · La situation par rapport au BTS qui se trouve juste à côté et qui permet de se déplacer facilement pour pas cher. La piscine qui est grande, l'espace extérieur agréable , serviette de piscine disponible , 3 machines à laver et 3 sèche linge. Une boutique 7 eleven juste à côté. Grands placards dans la chambre.Disliked
 · Le petit déjeuner peu varié. Il y a plus de choses salées. 
Un sachet avec quelques aliments posé sur la table a disparu un jour, rien n'a été fait la femme de ménage a nié et on m'a regardé comme si je mentais !
Quelques odeurs d'égouts. C'est un peu vieillot, les chambres sont sombres. Les matelas des transats sont tachés. Les saunas sont minuscules et ne sont pas en fonction. Pas de table et fer à repasser dans la chambre contrairement à ce qui est noté. 
Le produit pour se doucher sent mauvais. Il n'y a uniquement que 2 bols, 2 assietes, 2 verres, 2 cuillères et deux fourchettes, pas de couteaux....

The pressure in the shower was very disappointing. It would have been good to have instructions for the washing machine. The breakfast was limited to the European tastes. It would have been good to have sliced cheese or something savoury to put on toast.

The whole hotel room was very run down. I believe it looked really nice 30 years ago. 
The bed was hard and uncomfortable. Instead of a real bed cover it was only 2 sheets with a dirty blanket between them. My pillow had a big stain on it which looked like dried blood.
The bathtub was yellow/old and the temperature of the water had more or less two settings...cold or scolding hot. 
There was no minibar, instead it was a big refrigerator which felt as old and dirty as the room.

 · Very close to terminal 21 & BTS, it is just 10mins walk, extremely good location, pretty good breakfast. Family suite is very big room, very good fit for 4ppl stayDisliked
 · We stayed in family suite , when you turned on the bath tub, water is yellow and take a while to go clear. Water temp & water pressure is not stable , sometime the water went cold and the water flow slowly. We were a group of 4 and stayed in a family suite. 
At 2am, we found that the door was broken and anyone from outside could just open the door. Hotel could't fix that so we were expecting to move to another 4ppl suite but hotel said it was full but promise we can get back to that 4 ppl family suite the next day when it got fix. We had no choice but to move to another 2 seperate rooms at midnight. 
Unfortuantely , when we moved to the rooms, One room's door was also broken, and the other room's air con was not working, so we moved to the third room & forth room. The next day, one of the room key card was not working, so we have to wait in the hot corridor for the hotel ppl and open the door for us. 
We expected we can moved back to the family suite as they promised, however hotel advised that they have already arranged other to stay in our original 4 ppl suite. so my friends and I couldn't stay in the same room. That's totally disappointing. 
I understand the price we paid was not high, however, I am just expecting a safe place with door lock working and normal air con.",32,"Royal President Bangkok - SHA Extra Plus

 · Hôtel idéalement placé en plein China Town, donc super facile pour trouver où manger et prendre le bus ligne 1 qui dessert en particulier le Grand Palais et le Wat Phra Kaeo. 
Chambre au calme malgré le quartier animé et bruyant car non située côté rue : la fenêtre donnait sur un mur ! Décoration minimaliste mais literie nickel et chambre propre, rien à redire.

 · لايوجد لديهم خدمه مكوى في الغرفه وعند الاتصال بهم قالوا لاتوجد لدينا خدمة إحضار الكوايه الي الغرفه وأغلق الموظف التلفون في وجهي ولم يقل لي ولاكن لدينا خدمة اخذ الكوي مقابل مبلغ 
الي ان نزلت بنفسي الي الاستقبال علمت انه لديهم خدمه اخذ الملابس واحضارها جاهزه 
 وابلغتهَم عن تصرف الموظف
 تعامل بعض الموظفين سي غير مدربين كفايه

 · Awesome staff, very friendly lady at reception, superior room was very clean and the smart tv was a pleasant addition. Close to new 7/11 and lots of motorbike taxis nearby. Will stay again whenever I need accommodation near the airportDisliked
 · Pool small and had dead cockroach floating at the surface. Location could be better, but you will pay more for the room. So it's all good. A new 7/11 will be open close to hotel within 1 week of review",36,"RoomQuest Sukhumvit36 BTS Thonglor

 · Staff were very helpful , organized transport , did some downloading and document printing , arranged room change as room given to me on arrival was not as advertised . Reviews on web site must be family or friends impossible to give a 10.
Also booking.com we’re advertising 1200 baht cheaper than I booked when I arrived!!!!
 Hotel firstly claimed I had booked a better room , but even the top room on offer by booking.com was less than I was charged . 
The staff arranged to let me have the same room as in the Hotel pictures , even though they did not give a refund .Disliked
 · Requested a 3% surcharge to pay by card .
The small Pool is inside reception area, not a swimming pool more a spa dip .
 Also no coffee or tea in bedroom , but a kettle !!, 
The electricity cut out every few minutes so could not watch tv , (TV was brand new ). Also air con, computer , constant power issues .
First day I had to call for room clean after asking in morning but upto 5.30pm and still nobody I finally asked . - maybe they cannot read make up room signs?
The distance from main roads is 15 + min walk . The immediate area is more industrial and not suitable to walk at night.
Clearly management are trying to create a niche hotel but for me it’s not much more than a glorified hostel at this time, 
Not a property for me . The reception staff were the best thing about the hotel . Very thankful for their assistance .",36,"RoomQuest Sukhumvit36 BTS Thonglor

 · タイのホテルなのに部屋もお風呂もすごく清潔だし、ベッドはふっかふかだしで、設備に関して悪い所が全くない。シャワーの水圧も大丈夫。Disliked

近くにコンビニっぽい店はあるけど、セブンとかでは無いです
セブンやファミマ等のコンビニチェーン店で買い物したい場合は、最寄り駅に着く前に買ってから来た方がいいです。
最悪グラブで頼むが正解だと私は思います。Show translation",36,"RoomQuest Sukhumvit36 BTS Thonglor

 · Excellent location overall very central to most places that we visited.
I have stayed in many hotels but the bed at this hotel was by far the comfiest I have ever had. Excellent stay.
The pool area is a massive bonus for such a central location and the staff were excellent.
Breakfast for the price is very good they had a different selection each day. A mixture of fruit, hot thai and western food and usual breakfast items.
Excellent price and excellent facilities will definitely return when i Bangkok again.Disliked

 · We travelled to Bangkok to adopt our son, hence we were looking for a calm and family friendly place. 
This property completely fulfilled these criteria, as there is a small quiet garden with pool, the staff is very helpful, smiley and nice to kids. Lastly the restaurant serves excellent local specialties.
The beds are large and comfortable.
Special mention to staff member Tum, who was proactive to offer help with our son throughout the journey and even offered him a good bye present at the end of our journey! Just incredible level of niceness!Disliked

 · The garden oasis is very relaxing, good size swimming pool and gym. We stayed for 7 nights on the 3rd floor with a river view! Originally we booked for 2 nights but then kept extending our stay because we loved it so much😅 the location is great for foodies, every morning you can expect food markets serving fresh food and fruits only a 5 minute walk from the hotel. In the evening, right outside the hotel, the locals open up their food stands and serve authentic Thai food. Fried rice, noodles, all types of meats and fish, it’s perfect!
We would definitely stay again next time we visit Bangkok.Disliked

 · The Raweekanlaya Bangkok was absolutely a pleasant surprise for my daughter and I.
I had discovered this beautiful retreat on bookings.com by chance.
Every facet of our stay was more than perfect !
From our arrival we were made to feel like anticipated guests the staff were friendly, extremely helpful and just lovely.
The grounds include tranquil gardens and a beautiful pool. 
It is hard to believe this property it situated in the middle of a busy bustling Asian city.
The property is actually owned by the King of Thailand built during the rein of King Rama VI for the royal Governess, which is rather interesting as it remains part of the palace properties for more than 100 years. In fact there are trees in the garden over 100 years old and just beautiful.
Our room was perfect beautifully finished the Taywet Suite with a private garden and outdoor private spar. It was spotlessly clean and the staff were very dedicated and proud to keep it that way.
The dining was delicious we stayed with authentic Thai cuisine for our stay, breakfast was included it was fresh with lots of choices. Again the Dining staff were very helpful and just lovely.
In conclusion this beautiful retreat was more than we expected we were very well cared for as guests and I would like to once again pass on my compliments to Nang the General Manager and her staff.
It was a privilege and a pressure, to have had the opportunity to spend time at this beautiful property we will definitely return.Disliked

The room was always tidy when we went back and the pool was always clean, they had Gardner’s going around daily to keep it all clean. 
Bangkok was a bit busy for us so it was so nice to go back to the Raweekanlaya to relax and refresh. The streets around have the most amazing traditional Thai food at a great price. Thank you for our lovely stay.Disliked

 · Location was North of the Old City, in the Dusit area but easy to access main sights with taxis. Breakfast catered for all cultures and was varied - something for everyone. Reception were most helpful in booking taxis and with general information. The restaurant was excellent with high-class cuisine. There were also some restaurants within 15-20 mins of the hotel and the Marble Temple, nearby is a must. The room was extremely comfortable and well maintained with beautiful, high quality shower products. The well-kept garden was the most beautiful I've seen with well-labelled mature plants and trees and a small pool. The Christmas lighting was delightful.Disliked
 · I had a room on the main road that had recently been painted and the initial smell when entering was off-putting and was a bit noisy. Some of the restaurant staff were not as friendly and smiley, which was disappointing as I'd been up North where service was more pleasant.

 · The location meant we were far enough away from too much commotion, but within cheap tuk tuk reach of many Bangkok hotspots. Also a short walk from a pier where the river taxi stops at.
The room was clean and comfortable, though a little small.
Breakfast was excellent, with a wide range of fresh fruit, pastries etc, but it also included a choice of freshly prepared eggs or omelettes with a variety of fillings which was very nice. The same quality of food we found at the hotel's restaurant which essentially offers fine dining at the price of 'normal dining'. 
Our couples massage was absolutely incredible too, great value for money, highly recommend the shoulder and head 90 minutes massage.
It's the perfect hotel for a 2/3 night stay.Disliked

Bed SO comfy. Had such good sleeps there. Lovely staff. Gym facilities were good also. 20 minute walk to Khao san road but that was good as I didn’t like that area anyway so was glad to be out of the chaos. Felt safe with fobs and security always outside.Disliked

 · I loved this hotel, particularly the staff. I haven't had a more accommodating hotel staff in a long time, if ever. They understood that I didn't speak Thai, and they helped me through possible headaches almost each day. I can't think them enough for my trip to Bangkok as fun and as exciting as it proved to be. I would recommend this hotel to anybody who doesn't necessarily want to be in the rat race at the heart of Bangkok.Disliked

 · The hotel looks just like what you see in the picture. Most of the hotel space are green areas full of trees, that's what I love the most. I stayed at the premier room which has windows overlooking the hotel garden. All the toiletries are made by Donna Chang, with a very nice jasmine scent. Staffs are all very nice, they are very helpful and happy to assist you with everything. Breakfast was good, and you can choose to dine in the outdoor garden, very good ambience. The hotel is located in the Bangkok old town, all tourist attractions here can be reach within 10 or 15 minutes. You can ask the staff to hail you a taxi or you can drive by your own (parking area available).Disliked
 · The room is quite small, and a bit dusty (maybe because it is a wooden building) so my friend who is sensitive to dust felt a bit uncomfortable staying in the room. But that was alright, she still enjoys staying at the hotel.",39,"The Raweekanlaya Bangkok

We tried to seat in chairs near the poolside area to eat but it was so dirty we had to ask waiter to clean it. And still dirt is so old they simply can’t get rid of it anymore. And poolside area is beautiful with all the trees and stuff! They just don’t really care to clean and simply look after it. For 5 star hotel it’s unacceptable. 
Alcohol. They don’t have it. But you can grab a beer or smthng at 7/11 and drink wherever you want, when we bought a bottle of wine they even gave us glasses to drink it. That’s just weird. If you don’t care that much - just add alcohol in menu so your guests can feel themeselves comfortable. And do something about food, almost every review here says it’s bad. Clean outside area!

 · Reception staff were the only people who were professional - all the rest were sullen, moody and rude.Disliked
 · Breakfast was appalling - cold badly cooked and pretty inedible.....room floor was filthy - our feet were black after walking around. Location required taking taxis extensively everywhere- okay being 'green' but away from everything. Our curtain in our room was hanging off the hooks for the entire stay and shower gel remained empty in spite of me highlighting the subject- no place to put clothes - had to remain in case for 6 days - 2 coat hangers on a frame. Bath towels were under the sink on a shelf - unfortunately the basin was leaking and the towels were stained and wet. When we were leaving or rather trying to leave a staff member was pressure hosing all the pathways resulting in non safe 'passage. Surely this task should be done at night. However, one member of staff depicted the attitude - she was the person in charge of the breakfast service and spent her time 'skulking' on her mobile phone around a corner instead of performing her duties.

"2.5","August 2019","A hotel apparently full of crooks and thieves, with an insulting management.","Disliked
 · Awful experience. A passport, debit card, and cash were all stolen from our room. Admittedly we did not leave them in the safe, but even so, appalling that this would happen in a 4-star hotel. To make matters worse, the hotel manager insisted on trying to suggest to my partner was lying when we reported it to the police. Given the hotels poor and insulting response to a theft that happened on their property, I would not recommend staying here to anyone.",39,"The Raweekanlaya Bangkok
