 · -Convenient location with lots of eateries around even till midnight. 
-Very friendly staffs and did their best to accommodate requirements (towel deco for celebration & understanding when we need extra 30 mins to check out due to emergency)
-Basic amenities provided for the bathroom and kitchenette & even filtered drinking water!
-Very spacious for 2pax. Allowing visitors till 11pm (T&C applied)
-Lovely setup especially the kitchenette & bar table. 
-washing machine and dryer at level 2 (think it’s FOC!)Disliked
 · Wouldn’t say that I don’t like it, but more like suggestions. Not deal breaker. Still highly recommend!
-no indoor slippers provided. The floor tiles are cold to walk on barefoot. 
-very steep stairs to the loft. Have to be extra careful when going up and down. 
-toilet tissue holder is too near to the toilet bowl. Have to be careful not to knock your elbow. And have to twist your body to get the tissues. (Not a big issue tho)
-pillows are too high and hard for my liking. Will be great if there’s different choices. Bed is comfy tho. 
Not necessarily but it’ll be great if there’re more plugs around the sofa/bar table area for phone charging, and beside the mirrors for hair dryer.",2,"Wanderlust, The Unlimited Collection by Oakwood (SG Clean)

The stairs up the loft is slightly steep, which is potentially dangerous when descending. There was no gym and the dipping pool was tiny with a lot of fallen leaves in the pool, making it resemble a pond instead.",2,"Wanderlust, The Unlimited Collection by Oakwood (SG Clean)

 · The entire property is very clean, the room has a kitchenette, the concierge is very thoughtful and brought our bags up to the room after we left it with the hotel for safekeeping as it was before check-in time.Disliked
 · The room’s windows cannot be opened so it was less convenient to use the kitchenette without the smells lingering in the room. We also couldn’t locate the switch for the kitchen hood that absorbs smoke.",2,"Wanderlust, The Unlimited Collection by Oakwood (SG Clean)

 · I didn't get the room in the picture which was a big bummer because i was expecting that room. And when i asked the staff if it was possible to switch she was pretty rude and said "" oh hmm...it's occupied."" I understand if it's occupied but at least be friendlier or apologetic about it? I used to work in the frontline customer service as well, and that attitude isn't acceptable. she could have said ""Okay, let me check. Oh I'm so sorry miss but that room is already being occupied."" There also weren't any pots, pans or cutleries in the room, why have a stove then?",2,"Wanderlust, The Unlimited Collection by Oakwood (SG Clean)

the hotel was very smart to make the rooms into a loft concept because it wouldn’t have enough space to be a normal room. that’s how small the room is. if there’s someone on the toilet bowl, the door cannot be opened because there isn’t enough space. no facility can be used & hotel 81 is just opp? erm",2,"Wanderlust, The Unlimited Collection by Oakwood (SG Clean)

Didn't get a good sleep during night. Request for late check out was told max 12.30pm. No water bottle in room. Common area like a pantry at the corridor to collect water fill into bottle provided in room. Oakwood chain no room slippers or just Wanderlust? Call several time to reception no pick up.

 · I love the fact that our room has beautiful walls, floorings, decor and a smart TV that is accessible to Youtube & Internet browser. Availability of a pillow menu was also a nice touch. The best part of it has to be the outdoor private Jacuzzi attached and its just perfect for relaxation amidst the bust and livelihood of the city. Having breakfast outdoors during the cozy morning is also recommended! Many thanks to Makaela, for the wonderful service and dedication during my stay. :) (I apologise in advance if the spelling is incorrect)Disliked
 · - No bidets
- Not much choices for the Breakfast menu
- TV connection is unstable at times.
- Room is not soundproof which means that the information listed on the site needs to be updated.
- Shower and second toilet has clear glass walls, its not opaque or frosted glass thus each person will have to take turns showering.
I requested for a refill of the Jacuzzi water about 1.5 hours before check out however housekeeping was a bit slow to respond. Since there was insufficient time in the end, called up Housekeeping to cancel the request so that they do not have to take an unnecessary trip down to my room. One of the female staff actually 'giggled' when I made the call which sounded a bit rude and unprofessional. 'I apologise or I'm sorry' would be a better response instead of giggling.",3,"Grand Park City Hall (SG Clean)

 · The rooms were great and the front desk service was professional.Disliked
 · Poor ventilation at the breakfast table.
The quality of the breakfast was bad.
I understand that buffets have been stopped because of covid, but they could have given us an option to order second helpings like how we normally get second helpings during a breakfast buffet. To make matters worse, the food was poorly cooked.
The bacon was so hard and salty, even a dog wouldn't eat that.
The omelet and the mushrooms were under-seasoned. Sauteed mushrooms with little to no salt or pepper.
Muesli was gross.
How can Smoked Salmon be considered a main dish? It's practically a side dish. It's so small in portion size and nothing was served with it. When something is something is served as a main dish, it is usually served in a larger portion than the appetizers.
I feel the restaurant has little insight into running a breakfast table.",3,"Grand Park City Hall (SG Clean)

Really appreciate the staff and chef there for their great service. We also appreciate Ms Melody, the staff on duty at the counter on Christmas eve for her kind help and friendliness!Disliked
 · The checking in and out experiences were sub-par. The staff that attended to us on both encounters lacked the warmth expected from a 5-star hotel. One sounded condescending. Breakfast on Christmas morning at a Crystal Club was slightly disappointing. While we understand that the staff could be overwhelmed by the crowd, we didn’t get all our food orders. Even the kids cutlery that the gentleman promised to bring us didn’t appear for the entire meal.

 · This property exceed my expectations. At first glance, it does not seem to family friendly (very modern, & hip) but was so pleasantly impressed. The location is great,, walkable to a number of malls, the marina & a slightly longer walk to the gardens. The pool is great for kids, they have a shallow area (where the are chairs set up) separated by a wall so the kids had a great time. The room was bigger than I expected, and comfortable for the two preschoolers and two adults. If you are traveling with a family, I would recommend getting the breakfast package. Great breakfast and there are few places near by that work. Also, our 4 yr olds ate for free.Disliked

If you want to adjust the light, fan, ac, temperature you need an app. That is totally exaggerated if you stay for 1 or 2 or even 3 nights in my opinion. Of course you could also do it on a very tiny old monitor located close to the bed (so if you want to have light in the entrance you need to go close to the bed first or if you sleep on the other side of the. Ed you first have to get to the other end....)which is very difficult to use because it doesn’t reflect fast and intuitive setting.

 · We loved the location of the hotel. It was close to city hall, great restaurants and many shopping malls. This is a small boutique hotel so they give you a lot of attention and the staff are very helpful. I would like to call out the great service from the concierge Lornie. He was very helpful and always ready to help us. If you like staying in a hotel that is well situated and quiet, then this is the place for you. 
Oh, and don't forget to take your swim suit with you. Their roof top pool is great for cooling off after a day of sight seeing. We just wished that we used it more often. Great to take kids here because it's not busy and there are lots of chairs and loungers around the pool and even some are in the pool.
We had our breakfast included with the stay which was a bonus because the variety was great and everything was fresh and delicious. Think we put on a few pounds from eating here during our stay. 
The hotel was renovated recently so everything in the room is controlled via an app from your phone or a control panel on the wall. So if you want to turn off the lights, you will have to navigate the control panel in the room. It's a bit cumbersome if you want to switch on the light in the middle of the night. The room looks awesome and sexy though! 
One of the way we rate hotels is their shower and bathroom....., Grand Park has good shower and awesome bathroom.....love, love, love the rain shower which was a bonus. And the lighting in the bathroom is fantastic for putting on your makeup. 
The room that we upgraded to was very large, don't know if the regular rooms are as large as ours. It's the one that you can see the bathroom through the glass window from the room on the booking dot com website. 
Loved every minute of our stay here. Will definitely come back again.Disliked
 · We upgraded our room to the 9th floor area and thought that it included the Club membership area which was on the same floor. It seemed that it was not, so we could not go there for snacks or refreshments during the day. No big deal but it would be nice to get a bottle of water or juice when we came back from our day trips.",3,"Grand Park City Hall (SG Clean)

 · The hotel is a beautiful building, staff is extremely nice and I loved how they handle breakfast busy times, they manage seating and let you wait before calling your room number, which avoids the hectic breakfast fights seen in other busy hotels. There is basically no lobby, just a small entrance with lifts. Not sure if this is positive or negative, it gives the hotel a more intimate feel to it (no grand lobby hall), which my wife liked. Pool is small but nice. 
MRT station is around the corner, as well as a small sized mall and several 7-elevens. 
Room is pretty and beds were comfortable (two single beds fit two adults and a ten year old). 
Everything is smart controlled, you can enter the room with an app, also control all aspects of the room with it. This is new to me and I loved it, keep it up!",3,"Grand Park City Hall (SG Clean)

 · The room looks nothing like the pictures. You’re supposed to shower right over the toilet. Chinatown is a very loud area and the windows are not soundproof, so the sounds of shouting drunken tourists and a garbage truck collecting the bins kept me awake all night. We found a huge dead (thank God) cockroach on the floor and many alive little ants. There’s no elevator in the building so you’re supposed to carry your heavy bags one by one. And the most appalling thing ( which is hotel probably isn’t guilty of) is that there was a stall with cut durians right below our room. It was impossible to stay on the terrace because of the suffocating smell of the fruit. And even with the windows shut it stunk so badly in the room.",4,"Hotel Calmo Chinatown - Staycation Approved

We were stressed and disgusted, even our rooms were upgraded. The staff was fine, they were trying their best, even upgraded the rooms, and felt sorry for us, except one of the receptionists, when I was telling her colleague about housekeeping, that everything is dirty and we paid much and get 0 service, that lady was just laughing ironically.

 · Дыра - дырой, но! Расположение просто супер! В пешей доступности арабский квартал (всего примерно в 800 м.) Рядом чайнатаун и литлдели,можно даже дойти пешком, а посетить эти три места обязательно надо. Вы как бы побываете в трех местах мира. От отеля недалеко до центра, хотя это уже и есть центр. В сторону Марина бей лучше передвигаться пешком через торговые центры, которые по пути находятся в на первых этажах высоток. Вечерний и ночной Сингапур - это крейзи. Город очень красивый и чистый. Пользуйтесь метро и такси. Такси недорогое. Питание с разными расценками,но можно питаться и очень бюджетно, а вот алкоголь очень дорогой и в магазинах доступен только до 19.00.Остров Сентоза это круто, до него добраться лучше на метро,пляжи конечно есть и чистые, но купаться не решились, так как залив был забит судами на рейде, а загорать можно в лёгкую. Кстати из аэропорта до центра города такси обойдётся в среднем в 30 местных тугриков(примерно 15 евро.), а метро на двоих 6 евро. Местные жители дружелюбны, хотя им далеко до индонезийцев. Для общения в городе нужно знать элементарно энглиш или в крайнем случае на пальцахDisliked
 · Брекфест не в отеле, но не критично, в душевой нужно быть осторожным, так как места мало и вода брызгает на унитаз и вообще заливает весь пол и по-нему приходится двигаться.

 · Die Lage des Hotels ist gut da sich um die Ecke die U-Bahn-Station befindet. Die Angestellten an der Rezeption waren sehr freundlich.Disliked
 · Das Zimmer war ziemlich klein, viel Platz war rund um das Bett nicht mehr um sich zu bewegen. Aber das ""Frühstück"" hat alles - im negativen Sinne - übertroffen. Man erhält einen Gutschein an der Rezeption mit welchem man in ein chinesisches Restaurant ums Eck gehen kann. In diesem Restaurant wurden wir zuerst einmal eine Zeit lang von der selbst frühstückenden Mitarbeiterin ignoriert. Es wurden uns die aufgewärmten Vorspeisen vom Vortag als Frühstück präsentiert. Weiters gab es Toastbrot, Butter, Marmelade und Nuttella in großen Allgemeinschalen in welchen schon allerhand anderes undefinierbares Zeug schwimmte. War man so mutig und wollte man sich seinen Toast mit einem dieser Aufstriche bestreichen, wurden einem dazu ein bereits benutztes Allgemeinmesser (1 Messer für alles) zur Verfügung gestellt. Auf der Suche nach dem Kaffee wurde man auf einen großen Heißwassertank aufmerksam gemacht. Der Pulverkaffee lag daneben. Milch gab es nicht. Auch kein Creamer-Pulver und auch keinen Saft. Wenn man nicht explizit danach fragt, gibt es auch keine Kaffeetassen sondern lediglich Wassergläser. Wir haben so etwas noch nie erlebt. Es ist natürlich bei diesem einen Frühstück geblieben.Show translation",5,"Lion Peak Hotel Bugis - Staycation Approved

 · Firstly, the pricing is very cheap for this location with clean rooms... i would like to point out their staff, the 4 counter ladies (not sure their names but they have been super helpful during our stay) and the housekeeper, a very nice young man who always smiles and attended to our needs even without a proper request (call counter then call housekeeping and then gets the item from housekeeper, which most hotels do)... we extended a few times and it’s all due to a family emergency but they have been so accomodating...Disliked
 · This are not complains but just to give rough idea what u will get...Rooms not really soundproof... En-suite bathrooms are quite small... don’t bother me for both and for that price range, it shouldn’t bother anyone as well...",7,"Check-Inn at Little India - SG Clean, Staycation Approved

I really don’t sense much effort in arranging for the request, and would have appreciate the management to be honest ahead knowing your G floor units are reserved throughout a longer stay by another guest, I could have change my reservation.

 · The woman that was attending the hostel was incredibly nice, sweet and forthcoming. 
Compared to Germany the price-value ratio is generally a bit worse in hostels, but this one was the one I liked the most of all the ones I've visited in SG so far. The location is great, a hawker center with a wide variety of good and affordable food is mere meters away and a street market and restaurants are also very close-by.
It's on the 2nd floor of the building, but there are both several staircases, as well as an elevator to get up there.",8,"Century Service World

 · I was super disappointed. For more than 30 minutes, I was running around the address not able to find a hostel. I was asking so many locals about the address and how to find it and literally no-one was able to help me. After that time finally one of the locals suggested me to walk up to the second floor where I actually really found the hostel. I arrived 23:03. I mean 3 minutes after possible check in and no-one was there. I was ringing the bell for 20 minutes and no-one appeared. So, the hostel employees literally let me stay outside with no battery, no internet without accommodating during the night. It was so so so uncomfortable and only because I appeared 3 minutes later. I would suggest for the hostel to write an automatic email to guests with a hint how to actually get there. Travelling is about adventures, but staying without accommodation in the middle of night is really unwanted experience.",8,"Century Service World

 · Es war verdammt laut, ich hatte die wohl d schlimmsten roommates (longterm) , die man haben kann.
Es wurde in der Nacht mit Lautsprecher telefoniert, lichter angemacht und die Betten stehen so eng nebeneinander, daß man bei jeder Bewegung des anderen wach wird. Schlafen war für mich unmöglich und das obwohl ich mehrere Monate in EINEM Dorm gewohnt habe und schon viel gereist bin. Wie bereits alle vor mir erwähnten 1 Dusche und 1 Toilette für knapp 12 Leute.

 · Stylish & soothing interior design for a 2 bedroom suite. Furnitures arrrangements perfectly balance both free and used space. 
Living room, dining room & kitchen are condusively arranged. For business people, we can catch up with morning news while making breakfast. For family, parents can conveniently watch over their children while preparing meals.
Masterbed room is spacious and fits a baby cot nicely. Kitchen facilities and utensils are of great quality products. Example, the utensils are from Narumi, which are easy to clean and maintain.
Bathroom is well-thoughout. There was a long basin, where couples can fresh up together in the morning. Of course, there is also a common bathroom for additional members of the family.
Swimming pool was wonderful in depth and length for a healthy swim between early morning till late night. 
Paragon & Takashimaya are conveniently 10min ~ 15min away.

 · We travelled as a family of 5 and stayed in the 2 bedroom suite. The space was perfect for all of us. And comfortable. 
Paragon is just next door so getting food and the overnight diapers we forgot was so easy.
I absolutely loved the kitchenette which had a multi-use oven and a dishwasher and an induction stove, refrigerator and freezer, complete with all utensils and cutlery needed for the entire family. We got some groceries from the supermarket in Paragon to whip up our breakfasts (which tend to be really early) and stock up on snacks and dips. Also the coffee machine and the coffee pods provided were everything the parents needed for the short staycay. 
I also love their toiletries. They just thought of EVERYTHING. Flouride-free toothpaste, thin-bristled toothbrush, spa-like soaps and shampoos. I could live in the toilets. 
Beds were so comfortable. The tub was awesome. All of us had a rested holiday at Ascott. We would definitely be back again!Disliked
 · If I really had to nitpick, these would be the really minor things. I think some items were forgotten from being placed in our room like our dishwashing liquid (but the dishwasher made up for it). Being an eco-friendly hotel, they didn't provide facial cotton pads and tissue was 2-ply. But really these aren't issues at all. This info is for those of you who find these issues to be important to you.

Room is good for 2 adults and max with a child. Will definitely be back again. Yes, hotel practice COVID-19 safety measure and safe distancing 👍🏻Disliked
 · The toothbrush comes with medium soft quality bristles material. Brush tip size helps precise cleaning of teeth/tooth, but just too thin that couldn't massage the gum well, thus experienced some light sore after 2nd day use. I will recommend guests to bring your own toothbrush which I usually don't. Also, since room has basic cleaning for kitchenware, suggest to have a kitchen table cloth so guest could dry up the mini pantry top after washing instead of wet surface each time. 😉",9,"Ascott Orchard Singapore

All 4 of us got our free breakfast at Kith and the portion was filling. Such a nice offer!
We were amazed when we got into our rooms. It was squeaky clean and smelled fresh. The bed was my favorite. The pillows were just perfectly firm yet soft. I usually wake up at 6 am but my sleep was sooooo good that I overslept.

Toilet, there is a bidet spray! Hooray! Some hotels don’t even have bidet and make us muslims so uncomfortable. The bathtub is so easy and fast to fill it up! Water showers are of good temperature and speed! Kitchenette, has dishwashers, and microwave oven. It’s complete! The room, has a tv in the living area and also the bedroom! soo nice!

 · The one bedroom suite was very spacious, clean and comfortable. I had a room right next to the entrance of the pool so it was very convenient. The pool was not busy and lovely to have a cooling dip in on a warm day. Staff at the ground floor entrance were very friendly. There was also a front office lady who took my complaint about being rudely awakened one morning very well - she was apologetic and respectful even though it was no fault of hers and she did not make me feel like she wanted to brush me off and end the call quickly so that was highly commendable.Disliked
 · During check in, I mentioned to the staff that i wasn’t sure if I had an Ascot membership and there was no offer to check for me. I was given a room with mobility facilities and shower instead of a bath - a heads-up would have been appreciated. On the last morning of my stay, I was rudely awakened by the housekeeping staff knocking aggressively on my door. She said that I requested for towels which I did not.",9,"Ascott Orchard Singapore

 · The hotel staff was friendly, chatty, and warm.
This room is actually perfect for families because multiple kids can fit into the couple-sized tub, and the bathroom is huge. 
The room was very spacious (there was a king sized bed, but there was still ample space in the room!).
The tub was bigger than my husband expected, and the hot water was plentiful. 
It was also safe for my kids as the bottom of the tub is flat, so there's not much chance of slipping on sloped surfaces, and the bathroom floor was sufficiently non-slip. 
I was pleasantly surprised by the clothes tree too. It may seem like a small thing, but because we brought our kids, there were many towels and clothes to be aired, and this was always a problem for us that we always had in other hotel rooms (wet towels that can't be dried out sufficiently are rather unpleasant). 
The location was less than 10 min walk from Outram MRT, so it's perfect for those who are car-free.
It's a stone's throw away from a row of low cost restaurants. 
It's also 5 min walk away from a major hawker center with many many many choices for cheap and good local food (Tiong Bahru Market) and just 2 min away from that is one of my personal favourite places to eat, a gluten free restaurant called Tiann's.Disliked
 · A small quibble is that the sheets felt a bit rough - I'm picky about this though and the sheets in our home have a high thread count, so maybe it's just us. 
Another minor issue is that although there was ample space for more beds, there was no option that we were aware of for adding another bed for our kids - we all ended up squeezing in the admittedly huge king sized bed.
Although the tub was the highlight of our stay, I would have preferred the tub to be deeper, but maybe that's just because I love onsen. 
Besides that, the only thing I didn't like is that I couldn't afford to stay for longer :)",10,"D'Hotel Singapore

Close vicinity to cafes such as Merci Marcel, Tiong Bahru Bakery, Forty Hands, PS Cafe, Drips Bakery, but also close to lots of great local food such as Tiong Bahru market, Ah Chiang's Porridge, Galacier Bakery & Tiong Bahru Pau is literally just downstairs. 
If you're bored and need some modern civilisation experiences, Tiong Bahru Plaza is also just a 10-min walk away. 
Room size was very very decent, and wifi was perfect.Disliked
 · There were clearly cup stains on all the tables. Tried to clean them off on my own but they did not go away either -- perhaps the quality and type of tables used needs to be reviewed. 
The balcony was also quite underwhelming. Was looking forward to the ""open concept"" bathroom, but turns out that it is in direct vision of the residential block opposite so it kind of defeated the purpose of having full glass panels.",10,"D'Hotel Singapore

The shower area does not have a shower curtain nor was it enclosed with a glass door. Hence when you shower the water seeps into the toilet area and making the floor very wet.

 · Johnny exudes the true meaning of going the extra mile without reading thru the pages of a Complete Idiots Guide to Excellent Service, it came from within him. A true gem to your organisation and one to exemplify from.
I was in awe when greeted by my name from afar despite being my first ever visit the hotel. With a warm fuzzy feeling and fresh scented notes of the lobby that greeted my senses, It felt like walking into your home with a personal butler waiting on for you.
He efficiently checked us in with no hiccups and whilst providing more information of the hotels' facilities, he went beyond to ask if we are looking for a place to grab supper and happily made a few recommendations for us. 
The room was spacious with a view, clean spacious bed and fluffy pillows. Presented itself exactly as what was featured on the website. I was impressed.
Upon returning to our room from supper, Johnny greeted us and asked if we enjoyed our meal and with a warm smile, he wished us goodnight.
Please extend our gratitude to Johnny for his warm personable service and overall wonderful experience.",10,"D'Hotel Singapore

 · Pine Hostel was the cheapest accommodation I could find for a 7 night stay in Singapore. For the price I paid, I was more than happy with the room that was given to us. They upgraded our family room for 4 to 6 person capacity room. The room was a bit small but we didn’t feel cramped and the extra bunk bed gave us more space to put our stuff on. The very comfortable bed, awesome comforter, and a working air conditioning made up for the size of the room. Since we mostly just stay at the hostel to sleep, it really didn’t matter how small the room is. They clean the room everyday and the toilet was well maintained. The place is near the MRT station, and surrounded by restaurants. There’s even a 7-Eleven just a few steps away.Disliked
 · There were only two showers (for women) and one of the showers only dispense really hot water so guests usually have to get in line for the one that works properly. And, if you plan on paying using your credit card, they only take cash as of now.",11,"Rucksack Inn at Tyrwhitt

Breakfast is quite simple, bread and coffee-tea, there were also few kinds of snacks/biscuits that can be consumed by kiddos. When we were check-out, they let us to leave our luggage there because our flight home was very late night.Disliked

He was responsive to requests prior our arrival which I truly appreciate. There are cheap food places all around, some are even open 24hrs. There are 2 MRT stations nearby, which is very accessible, bus stops are also just a few steps away. It's a really cozy neighborhood and considering the threat of the latest NCov, he keeps us updated with what's going on and what they are doing about it. Make us feel secure during our stay.

 · We were in Singapore for school excursions and hostel was the best option for us to always be in group all the time. The electric switch tripped every 15 mins. We couldn’t sleep the whole first night as we had to switch back on the power switch box ourselves. That was after we complained about it, the front desk staff scolded us saying unnecessary things, he said that he worked 18 hours a day and he doesn’t have time to accommodate our needs as paying guests of the hostel. We were a school group with 9 children and 12 teachers, therefore we need to make sure the kids sleep safe and well. The hostel should take action on the electric switch problem as it is not safe for guests if there would be fire caused by the trips. The whole floor has only 2 showers and we had to queue up to shower. As a teacher and parent, I would not recommend this hostel.",11,"Rucksack Inn at Tyrwhitt

 · 3 days before arrival they offer us to move due to renovation and propose another hostel which is not in a better condition compare to Pines. I rejected and they confirm we can check in as per our arrangement.
Upon arrival, we were asked to pay on cash. It's quite a lot, I wished they have told us earlier so we can prepare. We were party of 16, so the charge was quite a lot. Upon receiving the cash, they didn't give any receipt. I have to ask for it and wait about 15 minutes to have the receipt sent to my email. 
When we checked in to the room, it was only 1 room with 16 bed and shared bathroom. What we actually order (and pay!) Is one of 8-bed family room with attached bathroom and another one of 8-bed family room with shared bath room. We might've paid higher than what we get. 
When I complained about the room, they easily said ""we don't have any bed left, you can cancel your booking and we will refund. We can sell the bed for $50 per bed"". 
I guess it was their intention from the first place to sell our booking to someone else. It was quite a bad experience, we will definitely not come back.",11,"Rucksack Inn at Tyrwhitt

 · La ubicación, cerca de ""little india"".Disliked
 · Caótico el espacio, es un hostal para menos gente, no puede ser que metas doce camas en literas en 25 metros cuadrados, luego lo llenes todo de sillas, mesitas y demás mobiliario. Me pareció desordenado y estresante el lugar, sin espacio para moverse, aunque intentaban tenerlo limpio y hasta cierto punto moderno.Show translation",11,"Rucksack Inn at Tyrwhitt

 · Super petit hôtel pas trop cher sur Singapour. On a vraiment apprécié l'accueil de David Peh et sa petite famille. L'endroit est propre, assez cosy. Malgré les fenêtres assez branlantes, on profite d'une nuit calme et tranquille à proximité d'un temple tibétain. C'est relaxant et sympathique.Show translation",11,"Rucksack Inn at Tyrwhitt

 · Расположение, до метро пешкомDisliked
 · Номер был предоплачен через букинг, но заселили в какую-то нору метров 6-8 площадью. В так называемом ""номере"" кроме кроватей не было ничего, и места не было от слова ""совсем"": перемещаться можно только боком, даже дверь полностью не открывается. Кондиционер естественно дует прямо на спящих.... если в этом мраке кто-то когда-то спит. Вид из окна на забор и мусор.
Пришлось идти на ресепшн и объяснять, что оплачен был номер, а не нора. Переселили сразу в номер нормальной площади, со столом, стулом, шкафом.
Душ и туалет устроен таким образом, что вода из душа течет в туалет и исчезает в слив рядом с унитазом.
В общем поспать и сбежать, такое... но чего еще ожидать от самого дешёвого варианта в Синге?)Show translation",11,"Rucksack Inn at Tyrwhitt

 · Bei mir im Zimmer waren nur ältere Herren (50-70 Jahre) die vermutlich obdachlos waren und sich sehr rücksichtslos verhielten. Im ganzem Hostel waren vielleicht drei echte Touristen. 
Der Wohnbereich ist schön und anständig eingerichtet. Es gibt den ganzen Tag lang Tee, Kaffee und sogar Cracker. Zum Frühstück gibt es Toast und Marmelade.
Der Schlafbereich dagegen, eine Etage höher, ist alt, schmuddelich und primitiv. Matratzen die auf dem Gang stehen, Wasserschaden in der Damen Toilette, Waschbecken mitten im Gang und Schimmel.
Der Eingangsbereich eines anderen Zimmers führte durch meinem Schlafsaal. Ferner gab es eine Lampe im Nebenraum die nicht ausgeschaltet werden kann. Dadurch war der Schlafsaal hell wie am Tage. Die Betten bestehen aus Metall und wackeln, die Bettdecke ist zu klein (ca. 1.50 x 1.30m), es gibt keine Vorhänge, kein Licht und kein Strom am Bett.
Keine Sicherheit: Das komplette Hostel mit allen Zimmern ist 24h offen und für jedermann zugänglich. Es gibt nur vier Schließfächer für 8 Betten, doch durch kräftiges ziehen sind auch sie zu öffnen. 
Ich bin nach einer Nacht wider ausgezogen.

Staff are nice, cleaners are doing a good job too. Several good cafes around as well.Disliked

 · Although mentioned it was newly renovated, the finishing of the room was not up to standard. There were some debris i’m not sure from the renovation or from the guest before.

 · I LOVE that the bathroom has a window! I like the spaciousness despite it being a small room. I love the firm pillow and mattress.Disliked
 · The wet, slippery floor after my shower is very dangerous! You should consider using non-slip bathroom mats. The blue night light on the ceiling outside the bathroom is a NO-NO! The bedside table is TOO SMALL! You could have a nice, big n cheap IKEA table and chair where the mini fridge is. And lastly........the noise of a mopping pail on wheels on the hard corridor floor is NOT acceptable in a hotel!",12,"Harbour Ville Hotel - Hamilton (SG Clean, Staycation Approved)

Hotel was located at central of 2 mrt and it was easy to go anywhere via public transportDisliked
 · 1. Room sound proofing was very horrible, could hear people talking and playing music from other room. 
2. Bed wasn’t comfortable. There was 1 mattress that was spoiled and could feel the coil of the bed. 
3. Light was flickering, went down to frontdesk to report at about 11.45pm and there wasn’t anyone manning the desk. Call the given number but to no avail.
4. Rude front desk personnel wasn’t really welcoming guest with a smile. Before me there was another customer that had a wrong booking and the front desk was annoyed by it.
5. Room was spacious and well designed but sadly wasn’t well maintained in terms of cleanliness and equipment . Flooring and the stairs was very dusty, Fridge had yellow stains in in. The remote had no battery cover, aircon was very dirty and dusty. 
Improvement:
Please try and maintain the cleanliness and ensure that all equipments given are proper. Please have a phone inside to room for guest to contact the frontdesk so as guest do not need to go down for assistance, soundproof the room so as we don’t hear other people room.",12,"Harbour Ville Hotel - Hamilton (SG Clean, Staycation Approved)

Water pressure noise coming from other rooms can be heard loudly. Distrupt your sleep. The building was terribly revamp/upgrading was poor, thin walls. I think hotel 81 interior design are better. I have no peace because some inconsiderate people making so much noise at our level. Shouting, scare jump their friends right outside our room.
My request has not been granted. I request for late check out at 12pm. But at 11.30am the receptionist knock on our door and informed that check out timing is at 11am. So disappointed.

 · 1. I didn't like it because in fact they presented a room type on the net and I received something completely different - a storage room transformed into a room, with no ventilation at all.
2. At the same time that I saw the room I went down to express my dissatisfaction and the service receptionist was immediately saying this is the room you chose and that's it and I can't change
3. On the third night i went down to ask them to change my room and said i could pay the difference. the service receptionist told me that they have only a vacant executive room and that it was not possible for me to pay the difference and that I would have to pay the full price of the room and the other amount could not be included in the current transaction, which I found a absurd.
4. I tried in every way to make him understand that I could just pay the difference and keep the room, but all in vain.
I ended up leaving the hotel and went looking for another one.",12,"Harbour Ville Hotel - Hamilton (SG Clean, Staycation Approved)

1. The windows in each of the rooms should be opened (the ventilation needs to be improved) so the air circulation and the air quality will be better. 
2. Guests who are having cough and flu should not be mixed with guests who are healthy and prone to diseases.

There is no table and chair for our things. We asked for the table and chair but the receptionist told us that they will send it once there is available one. But until we checked-out there was no tables and chairs available. The room was so dirty. The linen as well smell something bad. The Comfort Room is dirty as well.

 · Other than the location. nothing to like about it.Disliked
 · Read the bad reviews and only booked cause it was literally the last bed available under 150 dollars for my stay. Can only confirm that it smells disgusting, sheets were dirty, plastic on the mattress (i guess that's a good thing, maybe keeping the bedbugs from other reviews out?), mold on the walls, floor dirty, the property is completely run down, you cant even turn around in the bathroom, the room had no windows, and the advertised breakfast didn't exist. If you have other options, do not stay here. Ranks among the top 5 filthiest hostels i've stayed in, out of roughly 50.",13,"Joyfor Backpackers' Hostel (SG Clean)

 · The location's near MRT and bus stop. A few restaurants can be found nearby.Disliked
 · When we went there, they asked for a S$10 deposit for the key card and S$20 for the locker even if one of the lockers wasn't secured due to malfunctioned built-in door lock. The amount of the deposit wasn't stated in their policies. The bathroom cubicles don't have wall hooks to anchor your stuff onto. The bed wasn't really comfortable, and blankets were itchy. They don't have someone to clean the room everyday, so the cleanliness is not something you expect to find in this hostel. No breakfast.
The worst thing was that it's near the road so it's really noisy and uncomfortable to sleep at night. The staff's not really accommodating.",13,"Joyfor Backpackers' Hostel (SG Clean)

 · Uno de los peores alojamientos de nuestra vida (llevamos viajando 10 meses y 2 de ellos en India).
Dormimos en un dormitorio compartido (en la habitación 3D) y había chinches en las dos camas...cuando bajamos a recepción a contarlo el personal no nos pidió ni disculpas ni por supuesto se sorprendió (saben de sobra que tienen bichos y les da igual).
Nos cambiaron a la habitación 2D. No sabemos que fue peor.
Los chinos que están en esta habitación viven en el hotel y comen dentro, hablan por teléfono o ven películas a las 2,3,4 de la mañana....vamos, que no se preocupan ni por la higiene ni por la educación.
Los baños son minúsculos, no puedes meter absolutamente nada mientras te duchas. Por supuesto no te dan ni toalla, ni hay jabón por ninguna parte.
Además de todo esto está lejos del centro, por lo que ni la ubicación es buena.
Nos da rabia porque se aprovechan de que los precios están inflados en Singapur y ofrecen está basura.
SINO QUEREIS DORMIR CON CHINCHES NO VAYAIS.Disliked

 · At the time that I booked it was extremely cheap as the hostel had just opened. So that was the main positive, and the fact that the dorm wasn't too full. There are no space pods in the dorm so I'm not sure why they're using that as the main photo. Must be a sister hotel.Disliked
 · The bathroom in th dorm was unfortunate. It;s tiny so you shower standing almost on the toilet, that's fair enough but there is no ventilation and it didn't seem to be cleaned often. With the way the door is designed it's impossible to prop it open to air out the bathroom so it's always extremely hot, humid, smelly (and obviously wet). I lowkey dreaded having to shower. 
Rooms were very dusty and I had terrible allergies that eventually forced me to leave one day early. New hostel but old building and the carpeted hallways smelled of smoke. The temple next door is very loud at times, including the middle of the night. Not super close to a train station. It's cheap but if you have allergies, want to be close to the train or expect serious cleanliness I would look elsewhere.",14,"K Space Inn 569

 · Free use of washing machine and cloth conditioner is provided. They even have clothes hanger at every room and sundry at the backyard. Room is comfortable and clean. Upper bunk is easy to climb too. 
Owner might consider automatic machine check-in like what alibaba hotel or something like McDonald ordering system. 
Layout of hostel may change to maximise space. Front door may extend all the way out then no need door access to staircase. Ground floor room may make into single room for better return while create more space for lobby. This is just suggestion, I'm OK with the hostel.",14,"K Space Inn 569

 · The location is close enough to the transit station to make it worth it. The price is definitely worth is considering for just like 2 dollars less you would just a normal hostel.Disliked
 · Only 1 of the 4 showers I tried had truly hot water, and I don't think they maintain the garbages and checked out units quick enough. I saw people's stuff for days that clearly they hadn't come back at all. And based on what they left, they probably didnt' care about it and it just was never cleaned.",14,"K Space Inn 569

 · I was told to check-in at another hotel with a different address from booking.com. The pictures in booking.com are completely inaccurate. I feel scammed. Unable to contact booking.com. Only can contact hotel and hotel can do anything they want. 
Rooms were downgraded during check-in without compensation.
Tricky hidden costs. Room service and cleaning are not included in price. 
The manager/decision maker with a China accent (not Singaporean Chinese) is not familiar with Singapore culture. 
Dirty hotel mainly serving prostitution from poor foreign countries. Geylang is famous in Singapore for prostitution. 
No parking. Moreover, Parking is expensive in that area. 
No refund before checking-in.
Managed by K Hotel Management Pte Ltd, K Hotel Group and possibly other name in disguise. Affiliate hotels are 1) K Space Inn 2) K Hotel 3) Hotel Calmo, 4) The Great Madras, 5) The Daulat and possibly more. I would avoid them all.",14,"K Space Inn 569

 · I made payments via the app, however when I arrived the reception lady told me that I have not made payments yet, I didn’t want to make a big hassle so I just make my payments there. They showed me to my pod and the bed was dirty, lots of stains and lints. The curtain covering my pod does not provide much privacy as people can see through when my lights if my lights were turned on. I have stayed in multiple capsule pod hotels in singapore in this is one of the worst. I have contacted them regarding my refund on the double payment but they have yet to get back to me about it.

 · I letti sono comodi e puliti (mancano le tendine per la privacy ma verranno installate a breve). La struttura non è moderna ma neanche troppo vecchia. Son stata una notte e mi sono trovata bene.Disliked
 · Alcune cose andrebbero riviste: la luce notturna del dormitorio non si può spegnere, io dormo col buio e ho dovuto coprirmi gli occhi. Non si poteva regolare l'aria condizionata, il telecomando segnava 30°C ma in camera faceva abbastanza freddo. 
I bagni e la reception sono un po' maleodoranti e oscuri. Metterei una lampadina più potente. 
L'ho trovato un po' costoso. Alcuni ostelli situati in centro, per un prezzo simile, includono la colazione.Show translation",14,"K Space Inn 569

 · It was definitely a good experience at this newly opened hostel. Surprisingly there is a washing machine and dryer for your clothes and it’s free of charge too! The staff is great, especially Mr Frank, very approachable guy.
In terms of location, very strategic! Close to the nearby MRT station, Raffles Place and Clark Quay. 
For backpackers that are looking for something affordable and comfortable stay, I would highly recommend this hostel!Disliked

2. There were some cockroaches inside the room.
3. Water leakage from the water tape. Also, water tape made weird noise like whistling when you are using it 
4. No room sound proofing at all. You can hear everyone talking or even walking outside.

Please get the wifi problem resolved or speed increased because everyone needs internet these days. At least guests should be able to check Maps and book taxi using their smartphones. You are lacking very much in this area.",17,"Tai Hoe Hotel (SG Clean, Staycation Approved)

 · 1) Very Slow Wifi ( Even after past customers have provided feedback and no action were taken and had to source out for wifi externally)
2) Windows are not noise proof (A lot of vehicles passed by the hotel with loud engine, thus affecting our sleeping quality)
3) Unprofessional staff (Wanted to add an additional bed to my twin room so I could accommodate 3 guests. One Receptionist said can while the hotel owner said cannot. As confusing it gets, it was my fault for not reading clearly their terms and conditions & due to STB regulation. However, one of the receptionist said cannot and continued to ask me how am I going to do that. I just said add one bed in the middle of the room because there’s space still and the receptionist laughed on me. In a hospitality setting, especially when it comes to customer service, no matter how stupid the customer request is, it is crucial to not show your emotions to your customer as your customer would feel angered or embarrassed, thus affecting the whole experience before even staying at first night.) 
Overall, this is a budget hotel and I understand 1) and 2) can’t really be improved much as there are additional cost incurred to it. But as for 3), it is something that all hotels, including budget hotels, should set the right tone and professionalism when dealing with customers as this would be deemed as the most cost-saving benefit to the overall hotel operations as it adds value to customer’s hospitality experience",17,"Tai Hoe Hotel (SG Clean, Staycation Approved)

 · I love the location and most of the staff member. They were really helpful throughout my one-week stay, especially the room service guys (I really appreciate the help). The check-in was smooth and they helped me out with the booking payment as well. The hotel is surrounded by a variety of food options, shopping malls and the metro is only a few minutes away.Disliked
 · The pictures don’t match the rooms at all. The room I had was very simple and lacked everything you see in the pictures. Although the look is not that important, most people book based on pictures and if it won’t match the reality, better not to put it there. After I checked into the room, I realized the desk was not comfortable at all (legs can’t fit in and the bed doesn’t allow you to move the chair much). The shower head cannot be moved and the ventilation system in the bathroom doesn’t work. This is especially bad because air conditioner is not enough to suck up all the water drops and the windows cannot be opened. Obviously you are either forced to leave the door open or you can get sick like me. On top of these, the room was infested with roaches! The first two nights I asked the crew to help me spray or do something (thank you again). I know the roaches don’t like going out in light, so I was forced to sleep with the lights on every single night. Luckily I had night cover for my eyes but even then I would wake up several times a night to see if they are on the bed. I had to kill quite a few as well and left one of them on the floor and even recorded them walking on the bed as well. Then they offered me two rooms and I checked both and spotted roaches in one another room as well. There is obviously something wrong with the entire place and if the owner cannot take responsibility, they will get into trouble eventually... overall I did not enjoy my stay there and I regret booking a whole week.",17,"Tai Hoe Hotel (SG Clean, Staycation Approved)

 · Not much. It was quiet and not far from the airport. The bed was comfortable. I don't know if the guy at the front desk was the owner or not. Didn't seem to care that there was false advertising about the hotel on booking.com. He allowed me to have a banana because we had missed the breakfast hours. Should really be called a Bed & Breakfast rather than a hotel based on the facilities.Disliked
 · False advertising on the Booking.com website. Said there was a bathtub in the room I chose. I specifically booked this hotel because there was supposed to be a bathtub in the room. Instead it was a very small combined toilet/shower/basin which meant EVERYTHING got wet when you showered. If you needed to go to the toilet after a shower your feet got wet. Had to keep toiletries etc in the main bedroom. Neither of us could not figure out the TV (and my husband is tech savvy). no instructions to advise on how to watch TV. Safe in room was locked so couldn't access it. no instructions on how to use it. No fridge to store cold drinks. Housekeeping hadn't been done at 4:30pm. Had to go and request more water.",19,"Q Loft Hotels@Bedok (SG Clean, Staycation Approved)

 · Well we were traveling with 1 year old son, On pics it shows different kind of rooms so we booked good one which includes 1 double bed and a single ( for my brother in law ). So when we reached it was aorud 12:30 am as our flight delayed some reason , i left the message for hotel we are coming late but no response . Well first of all hotel building was not easy to find then room was so little where we stayed you hardly even move around , then i paid extra money to get double bed and single bed room but they said sorry that room you booked is not available. We were so tired don't wanna be argue on that moment as our toddler needs sleep. Funny thing was the they showed in picture is completely different as it is actual. Also i booked that room almost 1 month ago the how the hell that room wasn't available on that day.
In the booking they said it included breakfast but we have been offered only bread , jam and home coffee. Kitchen was not up to standard, flies were everywhere. So me and my wife decided to leave earlier. So we paid whole day booking but we left by 10 am so basically we stayed around 9 hours.",19,"Q Loft Hotels@Bedok (SG Clean, Staycation Approved)

 · Easily the worst booking I have ever made on booking.com. 
1)The contact number mentioned is never reachable. 
2) There were no lifts and my old parents who travelled from LA on a 17 hrs flight has to climb stairs to their room. No staff helped with their luggage
3) initial interaction with the property on booking.com wasn't satisfactory. The tone of the messages were unpleasant, rude and unprofessional. (Example not addressing as Dear Customer )
4) No intercom in the room. Can you believe? I wanted to urgently reach them and after an hour of trying the hotels reception I got through to know they dont have the facility to transfer the call to the room. USD 125 per night and you dont have a basic facility? Shame!",19,"Q Loft Hotels@Bedok (SG Clean, Staycation Approved)

 · スタッフが親切、丁寧。部屋がきれい。広い。ベッドも寝心地良かったです。バス停がすぐ近くにあり、中心部に出かけるのに便利。ミネラルウォーターが２本ついていた。ホテルの並びにマッサージ屋さんがある、道路を渡った反対側には、屋台系のお店がいくつかはいったマーケットがある。その中に２４時間空いているスーパーマーケットもある。早朝６時発の飛行機。その時間はMRTも走ってないので、チャンギ空港まではタクシー（Grabアプリで呼んだ）頼み。中心地は遠いけど空港には近い。お安くすみました。Disliked
 · 小さなシャワーブースは覚悟していましたが、部屋付けのボイラーがとっても小さい！！だから、「ぬるい」というよりほぼ冷たいシャワーは拷問。気候の暑い地方の特色なのか・・（他の安いホテルでも経験済み）。あと、ホテルの出入り口がとっても小さいので、並びのお店に紛れて、GPSのMAP利用しながらでもわかりづらい。MRT・タナメラ駅から徒歩５００ｍぐらいも、灼熱のなか徒歩で歩くの大変。あとから知ったが、タナメラ駅から路線バスに乗り継いだら、苦労なく行けました。Show translation",19,"Q Loft Hotels@Bedok (SG Clean, Staycation Approved)

 · prendendo un taxi, l'aereoporto è abbastanza vicino. nonostante si trovi in periferia in una brutta zona, mi è sembrata comunque un'area abbastanza tranquilla per poter girare anche la sera. il personale dorme in una stanza nel corridoio di uscita quindi suonando il campanello si può fare checkout anche la mattina presto.Disliked
 · La struttura è situata in un quartiere di periferia a circa un quarto d'ora a piedi dalla fermata della metro. Appena arrivati siamo rimasti letteralmente shockati. la struttura non è un hotel, bensì una specie di appartamento convertito in tante stanze con muri di cartongesso sottilissimi (si sente addirittura i colpi di tosse delle stanze vicine). Ma la cosa sconvolgente è che la stanza non era assolutamente come le foto di booking mostravano: un vecchio materasso buttato per terra costituiva l'unico mobilio della camera. Il bagno era sporchissimo (al nostro arrivo c'era l'angolo doccia allagato), il letto aveva lenzuola che probabilmente non erano state cambiate in quanto abbiamo trovato diversi capelli. Eravamo in due che dovevam farci la doccia ma l'acqua calda si è esaurita dopo cinque minuti di utilizzo. Asciuga capelli assente. Wifi disponibile al massimo per un dispositivo. Il personale in servizio è stato molto scortese e scorbutico. siamo arrivati alle dieci di sera ma il tavolo che funge da reception era deserto. abbiamo dovuto attendere un quarto d'ora che si presentasse qualcuno (un uomo che stava dormendo nella stanza adiacente che si è presentato in vestaglia con fare molto infastidito come se fosse colpa nostro che lo abbiamo svegliato). come ciliegina sulla torta, abbiamo lasciato la struttura alle 6.45 di mattina. non abbiamo potuto usufruire della colazione inclusa perché, nonostante i tavoli fossero già pronti, ci è stato impedito di sederci perché la colazione apre alle 7 e il personale non ci ha permesso neppure di prendere panino. grazie e a mai piùShow translation",19,"Q Loft Hotels@Bedok (SG Clean, Staycation Approved)

 · The room aircon and shower are great. Sufficient hot water and water pressure is good. Hotel is so quiet during night hour and sure will fall asleep peacefully. The hotel is near restaurant and 7-11 convenient shop operate 24/7 hours.Disliked
 · Room bed are to hard and pillow too soft for your head rest. Double bed are too large need to climb on the bed to close the curtain.The bed blanket is too short can't cover your body if cool.
No proper place to hang your clothing only provided cloth hooks for the hanger where is not so practical.
Toilet area are too small ,you can stand only in one direction when shower. Difficult to move cause the toilet bowl obstruct the movement.
Toilet door are dirty with black stain.

 · 굉장히 저렴한 가격, 그 정도 퀄리티 방
연달아서 며칠동안 숙박하면 청소안해준다는 후기가 있는데 1층에 Room cleaning이라고 적혀있는 박스에 열쇠넣어두면 청소해줍니다.
바닥 청소 한번 해놓고 살면 살만합니다.
직원분들이 친절합니다.Disliked
 · 냉장고가 없고 잠만 잘 공간
이불보가 낡아서 좀 더러워 보입니다.
청소하시는 분은 방에 신발 신고 들어가지 않는데 투숙객은 방에 신발 신고 들어가서 바닥이 더럽습니다.Show translation",20,"K Hotel 14 (SG Clean)

 · RienDisliked
 · Hotel très mal situé dans un quartier pas très fréquentable. Rapport qualité prix très mauvais, très cher avec des taxes qui s'ajoutent en plus sur place pour une chambre sale. Le papier peint se décolle, le mur est moisi, les draps sales et pleins de taches notamment de sang, la chambre beaucoup plus petite que sur les photos, impossible de mettre ses valises sans les avoir sous les pieds, presque pas d'équipement. 
Personne ne nettoie la chambre pendant le séjour, personne pour vider la poubelle et on doit demander le papier toilette nous même à l'accueil. 
Personnel désagréable, qui se fiche pas mal de ses clients

 · The hotel location is convenient, and self-check-in and check-out are doable, which is likely to be a trend for the hotel industry in the future.Disliked
 · The so-called window is very narrow and is made of frosted glass which essentially makes you see nothing outside, and cannot be opened. Moreover, as mentioned by a few other comments, the hotel room is very bad at soundproofing. It's OK at night since my neighbors did not make any noise, but you can't expect to sleep beyond 7:30 am due to all the cleaning/door slamming noise outside, unless you try ear-plugs.",23,"ST Signature Bugis Beach, max 12 hours stay between 9PM and 7AM (SG Clean, Staycation Approved)

 · The hotel is an absolute value for money and location wise very convenient. you can reach all the attractions very easily either by a cab/mrt or city bus which is very well connected with all the places of attractions. 7/11 and many other restaurants near by. If you are from India then Little India/Mustafa Center is at a walking distance.Disliked
 · Breakfast!..........The hotel was wonderful staff, very clean, but its dining is horrible enough to take away all its credit. The dining is a one man show with two helpers. The menu remains fixed with four items. A chicken sandwich and 3 noodles based items with all non veg toppings only. The delivery time would be over 30 mins. So if you are planning to have breakfast and move on for sight seeing then chances are that you will be delayed by an hour. Also if you are someone whos breakfast starts with a toast/cornflakes with jam and eggs etc, then its surely going to disappoint you. We only had b'fast for a day, but all our remaining day we preferred to skip and have it outside. Also the hotel should clearly spell out what all the items are included in the breakfast as standard. The dining is more geared to serve local customers. For international visitors, I think they are not aware what goes as standard. The hotel has a clear scope of improving this area.",24,"J8 Hotel (SG Clean)

 · The room was comfortable (bedding was changed out regularly) & the location was convenient (easy walking distance between 3 MRT stations - green, purple & blue lines - with plenty of food options). Staff were friendly & helpful (when I forgot my key card inside the room & my door lock wasn't working properly). Room has a safe (although not attached to the wall). A good budget location (by Singapore's standards) without compromising on amenities (albeit the room was quite small). The first night complimentary snacks were appreciated, as was the 2 free water bottles every day after that.Disliked
 · The breakfast was a little lacking (it was semi-buffet & there were apples, but more vegetables in the main a la carte options would definitely be appreciated - it's mostly carbs & meat!). Could have had better plug socket access near to the bed (not taken up by other bedside table amenities). Apparently the hotel is in a red light district, but it isn't really in your face (just noticed that it was mainly older single men out & about at the 24/7 cafes at night, & that there were numerous 'karaoke bars' with blacked out windows at night as well). Could attach safe to wall for better security & increase the lip of the shower edge (bathroom gets flooded very easily). Would have also appreciated slippers (since the floor is all hard & the bathroom can get very slippery when flooded).",24,"J8 Hotel (SG Clean)

 · The bathroom was very spacious, the room was comfortable, bed was good, I liked the big windows, AC was fantastic, the complimentary mini bar was a plus!
The location is good, in Little India and within minutes from several restaurants, the metro station is around 10min walk which is not bad.
The waffles served at breakfast were yummy. Coffee and juice were good too.
Some people complained about the size of their rooms, our room was the last one on the 7th floor and it was bigger than the middle rooms, maybe we were lucky as I cannot complain about the size.Disliked
 · The receptionist could be a bit more friendly, he would barely open his mouth to talk which made it really hard to understand. The staff at breakfast are really slow, there were a lot of dirty tables and the breakfast orders were all messed up, maybe there aren't enough people working, I don't know...
I would rate this hotel a lot higher if they maybe trained their staff to be a bit more friendly and offer better customer service. Having said that, we had to leave our bags as we had a late flight and one of the staff in the afternoon was nice.",24,"J8 Hotel (SG Clean)

 · Really helpful staff. Got upgraded on the room free of charge, which was unexpected. A lovely room in the attic with a balcony. The food in the evening was really quite good as long as you aren't expecting huge portions (which we weren't!). Good location for Little India and if you don't mind walking, the city centre is around 30 minutes on foot. Our taxi driver recommended the local restaurants and she was right. Not for a romantic meal, but the food was excellent and great value. Kept our bags in the hotel for free after we checked out. All round, a really good hotel.Disliked

 · The front desk staff are not organised and not systematic. Keep the guest waiting in the queue for almost 40mins. Due to covid19 they should be prepared to entertain guest especially on peak days. This Guy named Joseph (looks like supervisor) tell us to wait until 2pm for the check in time, then when 2pm comes all the staff in the front desk can't figure out whether which room is ready for check in.

 · 1. Did not key in my credit card details, was just trying the date to check price, but the app showed that booking had already been done. Cancellation would incur a fee almost equivalent to the room charge.
2) Was told that I had to wait till 2pm to check in although I reached the hotel only an hour earlier. The time was non-negotiable.
3) TV was not fully working. Called the reception desk for attention to the TV a few times but got no action. Had to personally go to the counter to ask for it. The reply to me was that there was nothing they could do, but still said that the TV was not faulty. How can the hotel put a TV set there that could not access all local channels? 
4) Requested to have my breakfast 10 mins earlier because I needed to check out early, but was unable to, had to wait till 7am. Breakfast was still not ready slightly after 7am and I had to wait again.",24,"J8 Hotel (SG Clean)

 · The room was smaller than seen in the pictures posted in the website. The balcony table and chairs were still dirty, had wet cup stains left on the table. The room was not properly ready for the guest(me and family), such as no shower curtains, no shampoo/conditioner, shower gel and had to wait for 3 hours. We left the room half a day since 3pm and had pressed for the ""make up room"" in blue light button before leaving and when we arrived back late at night, it was not even made up. When I called the front desk to ask why the room was not made up, the chinese male staff made excuses.The blanket sheets are not so clean(dusty) and not white in colour. The trash bin was so full and when called for the staff to clear it, I ended up changing the trash bin while the chinese male staff was just standing infront of me outside my room. We also asked for bath towels and the same chinese male staff gave us floor towels instead of bath towels and we did not use them at all. The breakfast was very limited in options, no orange juice and milk was given only after asking only had milk. I found a small green plastic string in my scrambled eggs. It was the worse staycation ever. I will never come back and even recommend this place ever again. I hope you read this and take my feedback seriously
