However after waited for an hour the staff innocently left the counter (went home) and leave us unattended until new staff replace and again we approached the replacement staff, then we able to check in within 5-10 minutes. We informed the new staff that we have been waiting for an hour and he answered, he didn't know we was waiting for check in which by right he can personally come and ask instead of talked and laughed at his cellphone.",5,"My Hotel @ Bukit Bintang

 · Bukit Bintang is a good location.Disliked
 · Bed bugs - loads of them. We went to reception to request a room change, lugging all our stuff around, and were greeted by really rude reception staff. We had clearly come down from the rooms and were stood at reception waiting and the lady working wouldn't get off the sofa - she was sat there on facetime. Poor poor service. I had to eventually say 'excuse me?! we need your help please' - the mention of bed bugs was clearly no surprise and we were moved rooms. There was no apology; just utter rudeness. We bagged up the stuff we'd worn in the previous room and jumped straight in the shower (which was grubby with a massive hole in the ceiling) and then examined the beds and surprise - more bed bugs! It was 2am by this point and I wasn't best pleased. We went back down and wanted to check out (we could see rooms were available at the hotel next door) to be told in a blunt repetitive way that we would not be issued a refund - by this point we didn't care, we just wanted to leave! We were then given a third room which the receptionist assured us was bed bug free because it had just been done up... Why weren't we moved there straight away?! Thankfully no bed bugs in this one. The next day we tried asking the reception staff if we could get the 'bed bug clothes' washed and were just laughed at. This cheap deal is seriously not worth it. The bed bugs were massive and when examining mattresses we could see nests. The issue has clearly never been addressed! The staff are SO rude and more interested in facetiming their mates than doing their job.
When we arrived my card (that I had given booking.com to reserve the room) had already been charged?! We arrived early afternoon so at a 'normal time' and the hotel stated 24 hour check in. I couldn't understand this when it clearly stated we would be charged at the property in the means in which we wanted to pay.",5,"My Hotel @ Bukit Bintang

 · Le seul point positif c’est sa situation géographique proche de Bukit Bintang et Jalan Alor 
Le point de départ du big bus est juste en face au niveau du Swiss hotelDisliked
 · En arrivant on nous a attribué une chambre sans fenêtre ce que j’avais réservé mais l’odeur de cigarette et de refermée était insoutenable 
En voyant l’état de la chambre je pensait que je dormais dans un squatte et je n’exagère pas les murs étaient sales la salle de bain dégoûtante 
J’ai un mari asthmatique et je savais qu’il ne tiendrait pas 
Je suis allée à la réception et on m’a changé de chambre sans broncher 
C’était mieux mais rien d’exceptionnel 
On sentait les ressorts de la literie je me suis levée cassée en deux
Le petit-déjeuner était deguelasse je suis désolée de dire ca pourtant je ne suis pas compliquée 
3 ou 3 plats salés une omelette préparée à la demande du pain de mie et du jus qui fait penser à du produit wc 
Je ne conseille pas l’hôtel qui mérite une belle rénovationShow translation",5,"My Hotel @ Bukit Bintang

 · The staff was really nice and whatsapp me the day before my arrival. Once I entered the apartment, it was very clean and tidy. With all the furniture, decoration are well arranged. Even the the cooking utensils were placed nicely. You can cook, you also have a microwave. Don’t worry with your laundry. Because they have a washing machine. Big bathroom. And include 1 bedroom. The tv was really awesome, because it looks like smart tv. So you can connect to their wifi and just surf the youtube or anything you want. The infinity pool was really cool. With the klcc and petronas twin tower on your back. One more thing, I left my jacket at the apartment. And then I asked Chris (staff) if he can send me back the jacket.

 · Firstly upon check there was instruction given to collect key in the Lavenderie office but apparently it was closed. So I approached the 'Homestay check in counter' instead assuming where I supposed to collect the key and ended up with the rude Pinoy lady at the counter. Finally managed to get the key. A/C for both rooms doesn't work well ended up we all need to sleep at living room with only 1 A/C and 1 Standing fan!
Shower head in the last room not working!
TV settings was in Chinese language however managed to change it to English after few attempts 
Pillows are dirty and dusty! 
Host claimed was not at KL few weeks hence he is not aware all this issues
Upon checking out was troublesome, need to take the car out the parking then only need to drop the key (which there was no space to wait at drop off point) 
Finally lift sucks",9,"KLCC Inifinity Pool - The Regalia Residences & Suites by KL minsu

 · But other than these, the unit seems clean?! 
Sheets are clean, towels are clean. Hair dryer provided. wifi and tv box works fine.Disliked
 · 1. the guy from the check in desk was smoking freely when I arrived and while he register me to check in, the lit cigarette is just keep going on on his hand. And he even takes a few sip just in front of me :(. While there is clearly a no smoking sign just steps away. 
2. Once we enter the room, there is a full size cockroach just stood by the door to greet us. 
And followed by a little one in the bathroom. 
It was really not a big deal for me, but my husband was no so much, he really afraid of cockroach. 
3. The unit was just located beside the highway and all night long, you'll be accompanied by the noise from the street. Occasionally very loud motor noise. 
And also lights from the street will shine in. 
4. The bathroom drains seems stuck a bit. There will be a small flood going on while you're bathing. The drainage flow down very very slow.",9,"KLCC Inifinity Pool - The Regalia Residences & Suites by KL minsu

3. The building is located next to highway and the sound proof of the apartment is horrible. You can hear cars passing by. Very loud and noisy. 
4. The curtain blind is not black out curtain. It’s really bright in the morning and super hot in the afternoon.

 · I LOVED the view from the apartment! You have a clear shot of the skyline through the living room and bedroom. Also loved how spacious it was. The infinity pool of course had an amazing view as well. Bed was comfortable, AC was strong, wifi was perfect. Although it took a few messages to get more info on the check-in process, the host did a great job at communicating and provided very thorough information. He also allowed me to check in earlier than the standard check in time, so I really appreciated that!! Thank you :)Disliked
 · I knew coming into it that the location wasn't ideal, so that's my fault. It's a little further than the main touristy areas. I ended up using Grabs for 90% of my stay due to the inconvenience of the metro stops and where i wanted to go, but that has nothing to do with the property itself--just something to be aware of. Also, unfortunately there were many tiny little ants around the table/kitchen area. Normally I wouldn't care, but there were a lot of them and it made it hard to eat peacefully. Also when I opened the fridge, a big bug ran out from underneath!! I couldn't tell if it was a small lizard or huge cockroach because it ran too fast, but that freaked me out. Seems like perhaps the cleaning needs to be more thorough, or you need to advise all guests to clean up after themselves. Only stayed a couple days so I didn't both me, but this could be an issue for someone else in the future if they're staying a longer time.",9,"KLCC Inifinity Pool - The Regalia Residences & Suites by KL minsu

 · Да в принципе квартира как квартира. Чисто, уютно. Мы находились на 7 этаже. 
В комплексе есть два магазина. Вообще хол (он же выход) находится на 4 этаже, это на заметку кто будет заселяться. Выяснили мы это ложе не сразу. Там же есть кафе - но мы до него так и не дошли, заезжали на 2 дня.
Бассейн не плохой, но эффекта вау он не вызвал. И он холодный.Disliked
 · Очень тяжело было получить ключи. Мы наверное мотались полчаса туда сюда. Как квест блин. Конечно все осложняло то, что я плохо знаю английский язык, но даже с учетом этого, проблема решалась медленней, чем обычно в такой ситуации. Когда все-таки получили ключи пошли до лифта. Лифт работает только от электронного ключа, что доставило нам хлопот. Когда мы разобрались все-таки с лифтом и как им пользоваться, обнаружилось что наш электронный ключ не открывает центральную дверь. Понадобилось в итоге присутствие хозяина для замены. А после замены мы не смогли ездить на лифте выше 7 этажа, что тупо, ведь хотелось на крышу.Show translation",9,"KLCC Inifinity Pool - The Regalia Residences & Suites by KL minsu

 · Die Unterkunft ist sehr großzügig, tolle Gastgeber, welche sich sehr um das Wohlbefinden der Gäste bemühen. Zimmer sind sauber. Wir konnten schon ein wenig eher in das Zimmer, da wir sehr früh angereist sind. 
Tolle Aussicht vom Infinity Pool.Disliked
 · Was gar nicht geht, ist das Personal, welches zur Anlage gehört. Ständig wird mit allen Gästen gemeckert. Dies ist nicht erlaubt und jenes ist nicht erlaubt- wir fragten uns was überhaupt erlaubt sei. 
Wir sind nachts um 5 angekommen und es wurde uns keinerlei Möglichkeit gegeben uns irgendwo hinzusetzen und auf das Check in zu warten - stattdessen wurde man direkt vom Personal weggejagd wenn man sich irgendwo niedergelassen hat. 
Der Infinity Pool hat zwar eine wunderschöne Aussicht, wird jedoch von allen Gästen nur als Selfie-Spot genutzt, so dass man dauernd darauf achten muss andere nicht beim Selfie machen zu stören und ist zudem voller Chlor.Show translation",9,"KLCC Inifinity Pool - The Regalia Residences & Suites by KL minsu

 · Die Lage ist voll kommen in Ordnung, links befindet sich die Haltestelle putra und rechts pwtc, kl sentral ist von beiden Haltestellen gut zu erreichen. Apartment war im großen und ganzen ok, Sauberkeit ging und eine kleine Einkaufsmöglichkeiten für Wasser, süßes, Bier etc ist im Bereich Block B auch vorhanden.Disliked
 · Wie jeder zweite Touri aus Deutschland, wird die Einreise höchstwahrscheinlich morgens sein. Darauf zu hoffen das man eventuell früher einchecken kann , sollte man sich abschminken. Daher der gut gemeinte Rat, schaut das ihr eure Zeit am flughafen vertreibt, wo man es sich in irgendeiner Ecke gemütlich machen kann , oder in der Stadt oder wo auch immer , denn auf dem ganzen Gelände am Apartment wird man nur von A nach B verscheucht. Man hat keine Sitzmöglichkeiten und das Rauschen gestaltet sich auch schwierig, für die Raucher unter uns. Schaut das ihr nicht vor 15uhr ankommt. Der Pool mit der megaaaa Aussicht ist tatsächlich nicht zum Schwimmen gedacht, sondern nur um Selfies zu machen :-(
Was auch echt anstrengend war , den Eingang zu finden. Man muss eine kleine steile Treppe direkt an der Hauptstraße gelegen runter gehen (für die mit Koffer, ätzend). Anschließend durch eine Garage die ca.50m auf der linken Seite liegt und da an irgendeinem Aufzug zum 4.Stock hochfahren wo sich die Lobby zum jeweiligen Block befindet. Super kompliziert am Anfang aber irgendwie kommt man schon da hin wo man hin möchte. Die tolle Aussicht am pool lockt jede Menge Gäste an, von unserem Zimmer hatten wir allerdings den Blick auf den Innenhof ,also ich würde lieber näher zum Zentrum hausen als dort nochmal zu buchen.

This is the residence part of the hotel. Theres shampoo and shower gel. But have to bring your own toothbrush, toothpaste.
My shower glass leaking. Water sips on the floor to the vanity area. Parking comes with extra charge. Rm15 per night if you want the access card- easier to go in and out. And rm50-100 on top of tht for deposit (preferably by cash) But considering the room charge an extra rm30 for 2 nights was okay. Overall I paid RM330 for 2 nights.

 · The location is perfect in the midst of everything. U can get Starbucks in the morning, different choices with Malaysia's great food for lunch and wonderful dinner nearby which you can bring home and have bathtub at night! In addition, mall is opposite of the residence! What else do u want when u can cook your own food as well since the place inclusive of the induction stove too! A place with lower price is a joy for me! Repeated twice already due to work travelling during this COVID time. Plus, easy check in and check out since they are using self check in system at the lobby by scanning your barcode provided in link to your message inbox and quickly scan travel doc or (IC if u are local). Keep the receipt since the wifi password and door lock is given there. Smooth and comfort which you get the wonderful Palace View at night. Another tips - Straight go to the lift with Dorset Residence next to Dorset hotel lift which u don't need to go through the lobby to get to the second lobby instead to go into your residence. By the way, Netflix is on them! So, bring your partner which you can ""chill"" together.Disliked

- maybe would be better if they provide tissues in the room
- water heater a bit unreliable. But then again, most of the hotels are.
- i saw a few minor renovation defects. It doesn't affect the stay, but prolly worth mentioning cause it can cause a greater liabilities in the future (probably >5 years)",12,"Dorsett Sri Hartamas KL by Roam

 · The place was easy to find, and the staff was very helpful and accomodating with my questions regarding overnight parking. The suite itself was nice and comfortable, very much worth the price. We already read some reviews that certain amenities are not provided(toiletries, sejadah, qiblat direction, etc), so we already brought some of them in advance. That should help with the overall experience. The Plaza Damas mall is next to the hotel, we went to the supermarket there and buy some groceries since we can cook in the suite. Overall, it was a nice quick getaway experience.Disliked
 · When we first arrived in the suite, the bathroom reeks with strong urine smell. We had to wash the whole bathroom to get rid of the smell. There is also no place to sit at the lobby area, which is quite uncomfortable as during checkout, my family had to stand awkwardly while I went to the car, exit the parking area and fetch them back at the pickup area. 
- Would also appreciate if there is mineral water provided in the room as well, as there was none during our stay.",12,"Dorsett Sri Hartamas KL by Roam

- cigarette butts at the “outside” area where the washing machine and cleaning supplies are located. Basically cigarette butts thrown by tenants from the floors above that get stuck in the slats. Housekeeping should have checked this area before releasing the room for the next guest.

 · The location was okay as we travel in our own car. The parking card is limited and need deposit of RM100, however can still park at the hotel parking, the parking rate was about RM 4 per day (if not mistaken). 
You can do self check in and check out so it was very easy and fast. They send you the QR code to scan for self check in and also the PIN code for the room. 
Grab delivery was also available but they will drop the food at lobby so you have to go down and pickup.
The bathroom is huge and the bathtub was nice. Kitchen utensils are provided so you can cook if needed.Disliked

 · This was our second time here. So I'm already familiar with the automated self check-in process and the requirement for hotel parking.
Really appreciate the consistency and warmness in their service!
1. Check-in was swift
2. The staff is friendly
3. Deposit for parking is RM100 & RM10/night charge
4. Room was clean and comfortable. With all the basic cooking utensils.
5. Wi-Fi was good
6. Water heater functioned as expected
This has successfully made into our weekend getaway list.Disliked
 · 1. Ideas for improvement: On our latest room (D-13A-20) there's a blank steel frame in the bathroom. Prolly something happened just before our stay. Prolly by fixing that (remove or amend the glass cover) will help prevent any unwanted accidents.",12,"Dorsett Sri Hartamas KL by Roam

 · The view of KL from the roof is georgeous. In general the layout of the apartment is not bad.Disliked
 · Hair all around the place, bathroom sinks washed, but not cleaned, 
all leather surfaces sticky, towels with strange ""milky"" stains and clearly blood stains, 
windows absolutely dirty, glass surfaces cleaned only up to height of 2 meters. This is the first apartment
which I cleaned myself, before I was ready to brush my teeth in it.
Leakage stains on the walls around bathroom, not usable cutlery, stains on the sofa.
Calling the external space for AC unit and washing machine a balcony is largely exagerated. This apartment did not have balcony. 
As a cheery on a cake, the apt has TV, but there is no cable or TV service, so you could only watch your own stuff, or just a blank screen.
Besides the dirt from previous tenants, the apartment looks heavily worn.
The apartment doe not have any cleaning tools. Not even possible to wipe the floor during longer stays.",12,"Dorsett Sri Hartamas KL by Roam

 · 1. the receptionist chinese lady with spectacles was unnecessarily RUDE, RACIST and down right of no use. Before you decided to change your hotel’s name you should consider changing your front desk staff first. 
2. was a hassle to check in, barcode provided is invalid, got scolded by the racist lady staff, spam of emails and different room numbers in each emails, access card did not work at the lift, cant find my room because the numbers on the door is apparently broken so you just have to guess which one is ur room
3. not to mention the racist lady staff “forgot” to give us our door passcode so we had to go all the way down (mind you we have went up and down at least 3 time at this point with all of our luggage) and ask again. so the check in was a terrible experience. Took us at least 2 hours to get in the room.

 · The room was big and spacious but very poor ventilation. Utensils were dirty even after complaining not cleaned properly. Bed linen too had stains which i took picture & highlighted yet nothing was done. Response from the management very slow. Literally wanted to checkout earlier but booking. com wasnt too helpful and did not follow up. The location is good and in a quieter area with a shopping complex. Alot of big blank ants in kitchen and on BED , highlighted to management too. The balcony is just a small space for the washing machine and not a balcony as its covered by concrete frm ceiling to floor so no view. Was dissappointing. Good for smokers though. Washing machine is plus point. Cleanliness and poor response from management was the only issue for my low rating. Otherwise would have given 5. Could have rented an airbnb instead.Disliked

 · Location was good. Room is big. The swimming pool has fantastic view as its located on the roof.Disliked
 · For a room this big, the dining table is a joke, soo small. And for the price im paying, cant even provide few sachets of coffee or tea, un acceptable. Other hotels i went to with much cheaper price can provide this. Please do look into this.",15,"Platinum Serviced Suite Klcc

 · Swimming pool located at roof top with nice view.Disliked
 · Room can see a lots of ants and extremely slow while waiting for lift even there are 4 units.
Is not appropriate to make a payment in person thru the lobby hall and payment should be made earlier to avoid guest contacting too long with the Staff.",15,"Platinum Serviced Suite Klcc

 · It was a great stay, a very good option if you're travelling in a big group of families since you can also cook and wash your laundry in the room. The location is also great since it is located in the heart of Kuala Lumpur and nearby famous malls and F&B outlets.
The view from Sky Deck was stunning.
Parking was also sufficient and the elevators connect you directly from parking to your room floor.Disliked
 · Our check-in option does not allow me to use my credit card. Should have this option in the future since I can see other hosts at the lobby provided this option. For those who are staying more than one night, please ensure you have enough cash in your account :).
I know that this is not within the host's control, but I find the rules that only allow a maximum of 3 people per swimming session is ridiculous when you stay in a 3 bedroom apartment.",15,"Platinum Serviced Suite Klcc

 · Location wise, its strategic, no doubt. That's why I booked there so we can have the view. I booked 2 units, love the 2 bedroom suite size and the kitchen island that's very useful for a family gathering, though I will have to comment on the cleanliness.Disliked
 · First, didnt like how this arrangement was done as we do not deal with the reception directly, Perhaps this was separately managed by separate management due to individual owned property. Second, the cleanliness of the unit was horrified. Bedsheets and towels were found with red stain, which looks like blood to me, but of course the cleaner is willing to change the whole set with new bedsheets and towels for me (luckily, if not I won't be able to sleep for the night), clarified that those may be make up stain. Well, acceptable reason but I think for the price I pay, my family and I would deserve a little more care. When I went into the unit, mineral water was not available, neither do toilet rolls.",15,"Platinum Serviced Suite Klcc

 · Everything (The room and its amenities, location and facilities) is exactly like the pictures. At first I thought it was too good to be true. But after consulting with booking.com Customer Service agent, I decided to give it a try and I really wasn't disappointed. The instructions and direction (to the parking) given by the properties via whatsapp were easily understood. The best things about this place for me are the swimming pool and Pavilion Bukit Jalil (it is really opposite of the homestay). Aurora Shopping Mall is also just beside the homestay. My wife and kids were really enjoying themselves during this trip. Kudos to the host. I'm looking forward to be this homestay's guest again.Disliked
 · Maybe the host can mention in the property's description that there is no housekeeping. But it doesn't matter because there is a washing machine in the room.",18,"Revo Home at Pavilion Bukit Jalil

After waiting for about 20mins, we informed the staff that we will go into the mall instead of waiting at the carpark wasting our time. Finally meet one of the staff (so called new staff) one hour later, he seems like know nothing just pass us the room key and walk away.

Iron and iron board already provided in the room. These is also medium sized fridge, a microwave and small number of mugs and cups. They also provided sponge and soap at the kitchen sink. Swimming pool at the top of the building is excellent, a large one for adults, a medium sized jacuzzi and a small shallow one for children. Towels and changing room are provided. Location is great, just 2 minutes from the LINC which have many great restaurant and a supermarket. LRT is available within 5 minutes walking at Ampang Park Station.Disliked

 · The location - It is on Jalan Ampang, not far from KL Sentral and at quite a distance from KLIA. There is a mall (Intermark) nearby, where you can get some necessities like butter, milk, eggs, bread, etc. There are quite some eateries around, not to forget the food court at the basement of the mall. There are many foreign embassies at a walkable distance. From our window, we could see many distinctive buildings, including the majestic Petronas Towers.
The room - We were housed in a single-bedroom serviced apartment, with a bathroom, a functional kitchen, living/dining area and a walk-in closet. The entire apartment has a lot of storage space. Walls are adorned with random close-up shots of flowers. Living room had a four chair dining table, a stand with a 45"" TV, two seater sofa, a chair and a centre table. There was another, smaller TV in the bedroom. Kitchen was equipped with a two burner hob, a microwave, a washer-dryer, a huge fridge, pots and pans, cutlery, cups, glasses and so on. Our kitchen had a Victorinox paring knife with an unparalleled edge; cutting fruits was a charm. Temperature of living room and bedroom can be independently controlled, the former has a four-bladed fan. There was a plastic carafe, which you could fill from the water filter in the lobby. They seem to have a fascination for cuboids - lights, tables, paintings, almost everything was in that shape.
All in all, the room was a delight.
Check-in process: The usual - show your ID, booking details, fill online registration form from Ascott and get the key cards.
Check out process: We walked to the reception and returned the key cards; lady at the reception wished us a nice day. That was it.
The staff: One word - Unobtrusive. Their presence is not seen, just felt. In our stay of three nights, we saw only the receptionists. Everyone else made their presence felt by their tasks.Disliked
 · Since I am only human, I will complain about some stuff
1. Floor is carpeted only in bedroom. We were given only one pair of slippers. Which meant one of us had cold feet, literally. We did not ask for another pair
2. Ironing board was concave. Since I had formal engagements, I had to iron my clothes. It was quite a task. 
3. Living room TV was on the edge. Meaning, it was not properly balanced. I was concerned it might tip over if we put the ceiling fan on a fast setting
4. When you are on the throne, finding the bidet/faucet is a challenge
5. It would have been much appreciated if we had hand sanitizer/s outside, or even inside, our room
6. Door to our bedroom emitted an almighty creak while being opened/closed. Resulted in disturbed sleep for all family members",19,"Somerset Kuala Lumpur

 · the cleanliness / the hotel smell / the property furniture and appliances / easy to access room from parking lot / the staffs were the best.Disliked
 · Water pressure in toilet need to improve. The water volume too low I've had to fill up the bath tub to take shower. Also booking for swimming pool need to monitor. we booked the pool and it was FULL. 3 of us unable to use the facility. Wasn't it supposed to have limited number of people who can use swimming pool?",19,"Somerset Kuala Lumpur

 · This is my Second-Time Stay at Somerset. Always love the room: spacious and come with bath tub + Good Location: walking distance to The Linc KL + Starbuck Self-serve Coffee Machine at the lobby: may enjoy coffee at anytime even at midnight ❤️Disliked
 · Poor Management + Customer Service: Hotel should be well prepared during the peak-season. I’ve requested the extra bed earlier during the booking and even received an email from the hotel (on the check-in day) saying that the extra bed is ready in the room; but when i check-in at 4pm (considering 1 hr extra for them to prepare the room); been told that the extra request is not ready yet 🤷🏻‍♀️ Same goes to the Swimming Pool- understand that covid procedure the pool is limited to 1hr for certain number of ppl; so we need to book the slot but end up when we reahed at the pool; they were so many ppl around. So crowded like they were not aware with the pool procedure. Hotel staff should’ve strictly check the room no accordingly before letting them using the pool.",19,"Somerset Kuala Lumpur

 · The water pressure in the main bathroom was quite slow as compared to the other bathroom. We did mentioned that we want non smoking room, however we got the smoking room. Nevertheless, we stayed at the 12th level, the cigarette smell was so strong in the hallway (from the lift to the room). The smell was so strong and retained with our tudungs and clothes. So perhaps, some serious and effective deodoriser should be invested at the hallway.",19,"Somerset Kuala Lumpur

 · I got upgraded for free on my arrival. The room is spacious and everything I needed are there like washing machine, toaster, microwave, bathroom amenities, wifi connection, kitchen utensils, iron etc. Also the bathtub is beside window (I love that the most!). Hotel also takes serious measure on social distancing by booking request prior to pool and gym usage. Also I salute that the hotel participate in green movement by providing water dispenser in hallway instead of plastic mineral bottle in each room. Other than that, the hotel's location is nearby LRT ampang park, easy to commute and night environment is safe for any solo traveler. You can get variety of food easily nearby.Disliked
 · The window beside bedroom (outside window) is quite dirty so the view at night is cloudy and not clear. Also the sahur pack for fasting muslim, the taste can be improved. I love the fresh juice tho, please maintain that :)",19,"Somerset Kuala Lumpur

 · The door sensor was not function when we arrived and we have to go down to the receptionist 3 times before the technician fix it for us. The parking fee was quite pricey but still affordable for 1 night stay. We got a room where our view was a building under construction and it actually spoiled our staycation.

 · I stayed in Premier One Bedroom. It’s so worth it. Cleanliness is impeccable. ID look so much more beautiful than in pictures on Booking.com. The bathroom, although not very large, but was cleverly designed that it feels spacious. And spotless too. Love the bathtub. This suite has one study room if u need to work during your stay. Also, there’s a walk-in wardrobe complete with bath robe/iron/iron board/slippers/extra pillows. And TV in living room & bedroom.Disliked
 · - No place to park while checking-in. My friend had to drive around the area while waiting for me to check-in.
- Breakfast was not good. Better order ur breakfast one day earlier at the Kenny Hills Bakers nearby.
- No Netflix. Just standard Astro I think? Bring ur own HDMI to connect to ur Netflix.

 · The parking service is not good. The receptionist should tell more about parking rate. I know about the parking flat rate is rm10 but they didn't tell the rate was only applicable for machine ticket parking not when using touch n go card. Other hotels will validate the parking card either using cashless card (tng/debit card) or machine parking card hence customer will get the flat rate price. If the person tell us earlier then we will go out and enter back by taking the new machine card. Since we using touch n go the parking charge is rm32 for overnight.",19,"Somerset Kuala Lumpur

 · Debit/credit card machine was not functioning during my arrival, so I need to do an online transfer to the Hasib account (because I don't want to use cash in my hand). Parking fee was charged per hour (can only use TnG). Don't expect too much on breakfast because it just simple breakfast (choose either fried meehoon or sandwich, no drinks) and you need to pick up at the receptionist — no coffee or tea sachet. Aircond took so long time to cool the room. Pillow not so comfy. Security is not so guaranteed because outsiders can easily access the stairs next to the room.",20,"Hotel Gulshan

 · We have to wait for 2 hours before we could check in. It was very frustrated because the hotel already called us in the morning to know at what time we would arrive. the hotel policy is to check in at 2pm and we arrived at 2.30 only to know that our room was not ready yet?! at first we thought its only gonna take like 30 minutes or less. 4pm still not ready! we only get into our room at 4.30pm!! tiredness due to 6hours drive and have to wait for 2 freaking hours at the hotel surely a very unpleasant experience. nevertheless, no discount or compensation or whatsoever was offered, let alone an apology. besides, the breakfast included for room reservation was not worth at all! for 2 person, they only gave a sandwich and a pack of fried suhoon. thats all.",20,"Hotel Gulshan

 · Очень грязно. Стены исписаны, всех сколах в подтеках от кондиционера. Муравил лазят, шторы все грязные в подтеках, мебель старая уже вся поношена и отколоты куски от неё. Персонал как только приехали сказал доплачивайте за комнату побольше типа вам не хватит места и тд и тп и стоимость в 2 раза выше чем наш номер стоит за дополнительный 2 кВ метра. Все слышно что в коридоре происходит. В туалете канализационная труба и днём и ночью с таким грохотом слышно как смывают соседи. Стены тонкие слышно как за стеной кашляют и сморкаются(( это был самый неприятный опыт. Остались только на ночь так как приехали поздно, утром уже уехали. Персонал не вернул деньги, даже не вернули туристический сбор. Типа говорят у нас правила если заплатил здесь деньги один раз то возврату они не подлежат. Короче это полная жесть, смотрите фото которые приложил. Никому не советую тут оставаться, очень ужасно.Show translation",20,"Hotel Gulshan

Гул стоял постоянный, уже непонятно толи от кондиционеров, толи болгарками что-то рядом пилят.

 · To enter your room level, you need to scan QR code first in the lift before you can push button level, so this is the safety for us. Stranger cannot easy come since they didnt get the QR code. 
The room is quite big and cosy. Very suitable for family to holiday. 
Staf also friendly and easy to discuss about the facillities. 
We can order for delivery services since there is no dining room hotel, but we need to pick up at lobby.Disliked
 · There is no hand bidet to wash because we are not very familiar with the toilet bidet, luckily the hand shower is quite long so we can wash by it. 
Just an idea, the QR code should be printed on the key card because it is difficult to remove the phone every time you want to scan the QR code.",21,"Swiss Garden Residence Kuala Lumpur

for my early morning check out, i just drop off the keys in the mailbox number N-26-05
ZIAD was so helpful by giving me tons of information, showing me as well where is supermarket, how to do my transportation
he was so generous by giving time for my questions
i was staying in: 3-20-03 with view to KL menara and twin tower.

 · guard was super rude ! reception counter staff wasn’t helpful. my 2 year old daughter and wife were stranded in the lift. what kind of QR code system is this ? why can’t the property validate Or activate the QR at the reception counter itself ? we had to walk to the guard house to get it done ! went into the lift from 5th floor to 22nd floor with guidance of a neighbouring resident. thank god the girl helped us out. it was sharp 8.27pm when I seeked help from the WhatsApp group the maplehome management added me. I got a reply only at 8.57pm saying my QR code is activated. air condition wasn’t cold enough. It was cheap and I got attracted to that! but never again I will do that mistake….. super poor service ! never again will visit this property!! maplehome please hire staffs offering good hospitality. best part was they took a deposit of RM 100 from me. since I had to checkout early they said will deposit to my account. when inquired about the refund they management said it takes 5-7 working days for a refund. pls guys don’t get cheated by booking this property !",21,"Swiss Garden Residence Kuala Lumpur

 · The unit was very pleasant for the price. The hotel management observes the Covid19 SOP.Disliked
 · The hotel uses QR code as mode of access for parking and lift, which will be issued upon check-in. It was quite havoc as we couldn’t access the parking because we didn’t have the QR code…and the code will only be issued after check-in. It happened to everyone and it caused long queue at the barrier gate. The management should revise the process flow to avoid such incident.
The wifi was not accessible at my unit (Level 15). The purpose of me staying here is to have an online brainstroming session with my counterparts. And one of the criteria that i looked up when booking the hotel was wifi availability. So unfortunate that i have to use my own mobile date to have the online meeting during my 2 days stay here.

 · We booked one unit with 2 bedrooms, it was spacious. The location is not far from other places we wanted to explore too, there's a nice cafe just outside the building can be reached by 3 mins walking. There's 2 types of shower heads, and the nice night city view from the unit.Disliked
 · One of our toilets got flooded with water leakage showering down from the ceiling to the toilet door and room walls. The staff responded to my emergency call by asking ""why didn't you tell us earlier?"" Like it was our fault for not anticipating the leakage. But nevertheless, they call up maintenance team and offer us to change room. However, we got separated to 2 different units instead. It defies the main purpose of our family bonding time. We understand the situation is unexpectable and quite a shocking to both parties, but however the way the crisis being handled, we couldn't help from being frustrated that is was not done as fast as it should, and also for the room downgrade (getting separated). And it somehow affected our stay because we have our plans already. I hope this gets improved because we originally love the property unit and would love to stay again.",21,"Swiss Garden Residence Kuala Lumpur

 · Cigar smell from ventilation is quite serious, after a night in the unit our cloths smells like cigar so do improve air quality since opening the window doesn't help. The kitchen also had some foul odor coming from the sink.",22,"Platinum Suites KLCC by SS Residence

 · The apartment was great overall. Everything is awesome. Clean and neat. Love the vibe of the room and the hotel overall.
The bathtub was nice. The bathroom is very bright in daytime because there is frosted glass half around the bathroom. Love this the most. The kids enjoy the bathtub so much when they are not in the swimming pool. But the yellowish water did not looks nice.
The swimming pool is on the skydeck. An infinity swimming pool 😍. Open from 8am-10pm. When it rains they will close it because it can be struck by lighthing (they said). The view of KL Tower & Merdeka 118 is very nice. Love it so much. But you can just see only half of KLCC because it was block by a new building beside the apartment building (still under construction).
And it was in the vicinity of the city center, next to Kg Baru (one of the foods heaven center). A lot of choice for grabfoob and foodpanda too. Near MRT (walking distance around 5 minutes). Walking to KLCC around 15minutes.
Although there are some things can be look out for your next customer to make your service better. Thank you for your service. 🥰👌🏻Disliked
 · The view from living room and master bedroom not so much. It's the city view but not impressed at all coz there is no kl tower, merdeka 118 or klcc. Asked for a klcc view but they said it was not ready yet coz I arrived too early (2:20pm). Already told him that I will arrive around 2-3pm. And it was a low unit (9th floor). 
I paid in cash extra I think because I don't have the exact change. And he does not have the change either. It was just around RM2-RM3.
At the time I'm there, the aircond in the other room is not cold like in the master bedroom. And their are some light bulbs need to be change. One is flickering and one is out of order in the living room/kitchen. And the bathtub water is a bit yellowish. I don't know why.",22,"Platinum Suites KLCC by SS Residence

 · - Poor ventilation. Strong cigarette stench upon entering the apartment.
- Bedsheets looked white, but if u look closer it was not as clean and has blood stains at the back. I hope they wash the sheets in between customers 😖
- Electric jug was full of ants.
- Only had 1 sofa in the hall which can accommodate 3-4pax. I would suggest for another sofa or atleast a carpet in the hall. And the sofa was old with stains all over it.
- Android box was provided but the remote control is faulty, so it couldn’t be used at the end.
- Rooms are not sound proof at all! If someone is talking in the hall, conversation can be heard clearly inside the room (totally dissatisfied !!)
- Parking rate was too expensive!

 · Room should be renovated to new image, hi speed internet should be link in every suites. Cable TV should have movies, and not just the ordinary free channel only. Door access on room 27-01, 2nd lock inside damage. Window hatch also damage, so the window can't close well and heard a noise outside from aircond cooler generator.

 · LOCATION : it is a private resident at the same unit of Berjaya Times Square Hotel, so we get the similar pattern of the hotel.
ROOM : I must say it was affordable and spacious for small family. Room was good (just like the photos given)
BREAKFAST : we went during weekends and the hotel serves buffet. Food is good. RM28 for adults, RM14 for children.
PARKING : parked at LG floor, easy to access to hotel and mall.Disliked
 · ROOM : a little bit dusty, and the furniture is out of date. The iron board is broken already and i assume they dont check properly. And got hair on pillow. 😅
PARKING : eventhough u got the private unit of residency, still they dont provide u FREE PARKING. So they charge you like any other shoppers - max rate per day for weekday is RM9.50 , weekend is RM12.50. Total for 2 days staycation (Friday + Saturday) was RM22 !
BREAKFAST : not so much variaties.",23,"Bintang Service Suite at Times Square

 · Die Möblierung sollte erneut werden. Sehr abgewohnt und fleckig. Sechs Glühlampen waren defekt oder fehlten. Der Föhn und die Fernbedienung defekt. Handtücher und Spültücher nicht vorhanden und wenig Besteck. Fliese im Bad und WC abgefallen.Show translation",23,"Bintang Service Suite at Times Square

 · Нам понравился бассейн и зона общего пользования. Детские горки, детский бассейн. Множество магазинов и кафе под бокомDisliked
 · Просто огромное количество тараканов!!!!! Даже залезали в постель и к нам в рюкзак. Ходили по квартире в своей обуви, чтоб не наступить. Не мылись с ребёнком, тк ванна в ужасающем состоянии. Все в воде и плавающих тараканах. Протекала сантехника. Квартира огромная, но очень убитая и старая. Срочно требуется ремонт и дихлофос 🤯🤬Show translation",23,"Bintang Service Suite at Times Square

 · Semasa ketibaan, keadaan dapur sangat tidak bersih. Terdapat sisa makanan seperti ada orang ada duduk di tempat penginapan tersebut sebelum kami masuk tidak dibersihkan. Terdapat najis juga dalam mangkuk tandas tidak di flush. Keadaan bilik selesa tetapi tidak bersih. Remote tv tidak boleh digunakan.Show translation",23,"Bintang Service Suite at Times Square

 · the room is spacious, quiet and clean. location is what i was looking for. good water pressure. aircond was cold. ample hangers and 2 bottles of RO water complimentary. beds and pillows are ok, there are complimentary instant coffee and tea with a water boiler. bathroom is spacious. few power outlets which is a good thing.Disliked
 · toiletries provided were odd, there were 2 towels, 1 comb, 1 shaver, 2 bar soaps and shower gel. no mat was provided or slippers, so after shower you basically walk around the room in wet feet. and also only half roll of toilet paper in the room.
hot water was lacking, only 4 working local tv channels, did not try the wifi. restaurant is closed most of the time.
during check-in there is additional rm100 cash deposit.
when check-out, the reception actually asked to return a phone charger that I have never borrowed. apparently some staff put a note under my room file that i have borrowed a charger the night before. that was sorted out, at least so far I was not charged for something I did not request.",26,"Cairnhill Hotel Kuala Lumpur

 · breakfast was pricy and not worth it at all. extremely understaffed and most of the staff fail to understand basic english. im malaysian so it wasn;t so bad as i can converse in Bahasa Melayu but i dread to think if they ever encounter foreign guests that speak engish for honestly the level of english by the staff is deplorable.the minibar did not work.
Worthless having a TV with nothing worth WATCHING AND RECEPTION VERY BAD,they could try and improve on their television reception and channels. to ensure items in room in proper working order. extra plug points would have been nice. maybe send staff for basic engish course. their restaurnt c;oses too early as well as the nearest restaurants. they should consider having room service at least till 11pm or 12am.",26,"Cairnhill Hotel Kuala Lumpur

 · The shower area. Only the rain shower was working, which is good. But the hand-held shower was not working. Please check.

 · Location is not too bad; Next to a Chinese restaurant for breakfast. And an Indian food stall
off the freeway, and traffic is not so bad
Easy to order a GRAB car (similar to Uber)
6 minute drive to Sunway Putra for quick shopping. 
Good for single male travelers
CHEAPer than other places I have stayed at before.Disliked
 · Not the newest hotel around
No shops within close walking distances (There is a a petrol station opposite to buy drinks and snacks)
Bed room and bath room needs a little tidy up
Bed linens are a little old
Can be noisy from other guests
Saw cockroaches and rats by the fish pond outside, but if you dont go there, its not an issue.",26,"Cairnhill Hotel Kuala Lumpur

The check in was easy, when you find the box-room and the management was nice. For the most part, a great experience. with some flawsDisliked
 · The swimmingpool itself was nice, but there is a huge building covering the petronas tower. So the picture on the add is incorrect or old, and should have been changed. It was only delivered 1 towel per person. I would recommend minimum 2, since you also need one for the pool. I would also like to mention that the curtains was not lightproof at all and the room not very soundproof. You can hear the construction work outside and the traffic loudly, and there is no way to keeping it dark after the sun has risen. The sleep was therefore not that good.",34,"Dorsett Bukit Bintang Residence by De Space

 · We had 4 guests but was only given 1 set of keys, staff were very responsive in delivering a second set however we had to wait until the next day for it. 
The kitchen was unfortunately not clean, there were a number of used water bottles left in the shelves and no floor mats were provided in the bathroom.",34,"Dorsett Bukit Bintang Residence by De Space

 · - Accommodation was generally clean and fresh, brightly lit unit, morning sun facing.
- Infinity pool was clean and good for a swim or relaxing soak.
- Washing machine with dryer was a bonus.
- Good security at accommodation, needs access card for entering into building and unit. Parking on site was available and convenient. Felt safe.Disliked
 · - Traffic congestion, not convenient if you are driving. 
- Security guard wasn't helpful with the collection of keys at letterbox, gave wrong information. Also, had trouble unlocking the code as number lock was not in good condition. Letter box area was poorly lit.
- Not even a shower curtain in one of the bathroom, whole area soaking wet after a shower; toiletries and toilet roll not enough to last through our stay.
- No housekeeping, rubbish piled up on second day; need to get your own trash bags for the rubbish after the existing bin was filled.",34,"Dorsett Bukit Bintang Residence by De Space

 · Situated close to the shopping malls and eateries. The apartment is big enough for 4 paxs with two bathrooms which is good. Easy to self check in and the communication with the host (Alice) is easy as she responds promptly.Disliked
 · Hand towels in the bathrooms would be welcomed. The amenities in the main bathroom i.e. shower gel and shampoo were not refilled and as a result, we had to purchase shower gel from the local 7-11 down the road. The wardrobe door in the 2nd bedroom came off the rail and thankfully nobody was hurt. Also, we had a roll of toilet paper in the 2nd bathroom that looked like it must have been soiled! Not a pretty sight. Quite inconvenient parking the car using stacker.",34,"Dorsett Bukit Bintang Residence by De Space

 · The property is located in close proximity to the shopping belt of Bukit Bintang which is within 5 minutes walk. It was easy to self check in and communication with the host (Alice) was great and she responded promptly each time. I am grateful to her for getting us out of a little problem when we didn't have the key and key card to access the unit as it was held by my daughter who was in another part of town.Disliked
 · I am not a big fan of the car stacker and accessing the car each time requires the assistance of the guard. Quite inconvenient actually for those who drives!

I was hoping for a clean hotel which meets the minimum standards.
3 days booking, No drinking water or tea refill, no cleaning service neither.

 · - Good location,
- Spacious apartment,
- Two bathrooms,
- Cleanliness, 
- The host has been available and reactive over whatsapp, 
- The swimming pool at the roof is cool,
- One large bottle of water (I guess a courtesy for the host, or maybe left by the previous tenant).Disliked
 · - We have been repeatedly hearing noise from upper flat(s), and it was annoying ... actually the tenants in the upper flats was moving the heavy chairs every few minutes and even at very late hours in the night (like 2 AM!!). The good thing is that the host took our feedback an promised to take actions to try to fix this for future tenants. 
- Other things to improve, put more dishes at least as per the number of people booked. The booked appartement can fit four adults (2 bedrooms _ leaving room), and I booked it for three people, but the provided dishes (plate, coffee mug, spoon, fork...) were enough for two people only (there were sets of two).
- Label the water heater switch on the wall as it looks similar to any switch making it not obvious to find it.
- Bedding was clean but not ironed",34,"Dorsett Bukit Bintang Residence by De Space

 · The room was clean and comfortable. Water pressure and heater work fine. The room is spacious enough, there was even a couch and a table (used it when working on my assg). There was a mini fridge and a kettle. No noise. Wifi was great too, I had no problem doing my school work during my stay. My friend watched Netflix without any buffering. Check in/out was quick and smooth. Location is great, right next to Kl Sentral monorail, across the road from NU Sentral. The hotel is next to a busy road but there was no outside noise, we could hardly hear housekeeping or other guests when in the room. Plus point for Muslim guests, the room showed kiblat direction. Received window room as requested.Disliked
 · Only 3 power sockets in the room, one next to the bed (the other side no socket), two at the table near the TV. I would suggest bringing your own extension. Also, no toiletries provided, not sure if the hotel really dont have them or the housekeeping forgot to replace them. Anyway, we bought a set of travel sized shower cream and shampoo from 7E next to the hotel. Requested for ironing board/iron, but it took 2 calls and a trip to the reception to finally receive it.",37,"NU Hotel @ KL Sentral

 · Location was very good as the surroundings are shoplots, supermarket, banks, food centres with coffeshops/stalls, etc, laundry services and malls. The best part is that it is near to the train station with several other choices and various mode of transportation. The room was quite clean. speed of the internet WiFi was just quite average. TV channels could improved with more varieties of channels, especially for movies, sports and news. Glad to know that they have safe deposit box in the room.Disliked
 · There's a bit of lack on bathroom items but I guess it is quite subjective and there was no religious books available in the room. should have some brochures for customers with regards to transportation as the location is located at the center of all mode of transportation.

 · It is a decent place. The location has two sides: 1. Good: it is located close to the KL Sentral transportation hub, so it is very easy to get here from the airport and also to get anywhere from here. There is also a large shopping mall nearby, lots of options for shopping and dining. 
2. No as good: because it is close to the main road and transportation center it’s often very noisy
Hotel has no dining room, but there is a decent street diner just next-door.Disliked
 · First I got a room with no window, which was a mistake. The room has a window but in only leads to the hallway and hallway has no window. So there was absolutely no airflow. The ceiling in the room was very low, room was small so soon enough there was no air to breathe.

 · The location is just behind Changkat street, and walking distance from Bukit Bintang MRT station Gate A. Staff are very friendly. Room size is really good and reasonable with the price. Water heater, TV and other facilities in the room work properly. One time I had trouble with water heater in the room, told the receptionist and the staff quickly came upstairs to help. Really good.Disliked
 · There was this one time the towel didnt really smell good. Not bad but it wasnt that good. I can still tolerate the smell but if you cant tolerate the smell, just ask the staff to change it. Pretty sure they will do it real quick.",39,"Vivids Hotel

 · The hotel has a strange smell. Whilst I understand that the hotel was under major refurbishment recently, I am quite sure the smell is not paint or other building material.

 · Locations is very near to the Bukit Bintang. Although have to round 2-3 times for a parking but that is not property’s fault. The rooms were super duper. The staff so friendly. Should the management of VIVIDS HOTEL give bonus to their staff especially that guy I forgot his name. Eventhough theres a couple yelled at him (which idk for what reason) he still keep calm and do his work excellently.Disliked
